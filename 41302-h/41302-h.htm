<h2>NOTE</h2>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">Every</span> one who has read "The Visits of
Elizabeth," in which a girl of seventeen
describes her adventures to her mother in a series
of entertaining and clever letters, has instinctively
asked the question: "What sort of woman was
Elizabeth's Mother?"</p>

<p>Perhaps an answer that will satisfy all will be
found in the following "Letters of her Mother
to Elizabeth."</p>

<div class="bk4"><h1><span class="smcap">The Letters of Her<br />
Mother to Elizabeth</span></h1></div>

<h2>LETTER I</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Monk's Folly</span>, 27th July</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Elizabeth:</span></p>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;am</span> glad you reached Nazeby without
any mishap. Your letter was quite refreshing,
but, darling, do be more careful of
your grammar. Remember, one never talks
grammar now-a-days in Society, it isn't
done; it is considered very Newnham and
Girton and patronising, but one should
always know how to write one's language.
Because the fashion might change some day,
and it would be so <i>parvenu</i> to have to pick
it up.</p>

<p>As I told you before you started on your
round of visits, you will have a capital
opportunity of making a good match. You
are young, very pretty, of the bluest blood
in the three kingdoms, and have a fortune&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
be sure this latter advantage, while it
would be more than a sufficient <i>dot</i> to catch
a twelfth-century French duke, would be
considered by an impecunious British peer
quite beneath contempt. Your trump card,
Elizabeth, is your manner, and I count upon
that to do more for you than all the other
attributes put together. Nature and my
training have made you a perfect specimen
of an <i>ing&eacute;nue</i>, and I beseech you, darling, do
me credit. Please forgive the coarseness of
what I have said, it is only a little plain
speaking between us; I shan't refer to it
again; I know I can trust you.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>These Horrid Smiths</i></div>

<p>From what you write I gather that the
Marquis of Valmond is <i>&eacute;pris</i> with Mrs.
Smith. Horrid woman! the Chevingtons
have met her. Mrs. Chevington was here
this morning to enquire after my neuralgia.
She said that Mr. Smith met his wife in
Johannesburg five years ago before he "arrived."
He used to wear overalls, and
carry a pick on his shoulder, and spent his
days digging in the earth, but he stopped at
sunset, as I should think he well might, and
invariably went to the same inn to refresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
himself, where Mrs. Smith's mother cooked
his dinner and Mrs. Smith herself gave him
what she called a "corpse-reviver" from
behind the bar. At night, a great many
men who dug in the earth with Mr. Smith
would come for "corpse-revivers," and they
called Mrs. Smith "Polly," and the mother
"old girl." And one day Mr. Smith found
a nugget as big as a roc's egg when he was
digging in the earth, and after that he
stopped. The funny part was that "Polly"
always said he would never find anything,
and he had a wager with her that if he did
she should marry him. So that is the story
of their courtship and marriage, and they
have millions. Mrs. Chevington vouches
for the truth of it all, for Algy Chevington
was out in Johannesburg at the time, and he
dug in the same hole with Mr. Smith and
knows all about him and "Polly," only
Algy never found anything, for the flowers
in Mrs. Chevington's hat were in the bonnet
she wore all last spring. But let us
leave these horrid Smiths; I am sure they
are horrid. I can't understand how Lady
Cecilia puts up with them. Mrs. Chevington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
says she hears Sir Trevor is one of
the directors in the Yerburg Mine. Algy
called him a guinea-pig, and said he wished
he was one.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An Eligible Parti</i></div>

<p>Lord Valmond has fifty thousand a year
and six places besides the house in Grosvenor
Square. You will hardly meet a more
eligible <i>parti</i>; I hear he is very fast; they
say he gave Betty Milbanke, the snake-dancer
at the Palace, all the diamonds she
wears. If he is anything like his father
was, he must be both good-looking and
fascinating. The late Marquis was the
handsomest man save one that I have ever
seen, and could have married any of the
Duchess of Rougemont's daughters if he
had been a valet instead of a marquis, and
the Duchess was the proudest woman in
England. The girl who gets this Valmond
will not only be lucky but clever; the way
to attract him is to snub him; the fools
that have hitherto angled for him have
always put cake on their hooks; but, if
I were fishing in the water in which
My Lord Valmond disported himself, I
should bait my hook with a common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
worm. It is something he has never yet
seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The African Millionaire</i></div>

<p>Tell me more about Mr. Wertz, the
African millionaire; is he the man who is
building the Venetian <i>palazzo</i> in Belgrave
Square? If so, it was rumoured last season
that he was to be made a baron. They
blackballed him at the Jockey Club in
Paris, and even the Empire nobility who
live in <i>appartements</i> in the Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es
refused to know him; that is why he came
to England. He is a gentleman, if he is a
Jew; the family belong to the tribe of Levi.
Algy Chevington, who knows everything
about everybody, says his Holbeins are
priceless, and that the Pope offered to make
him a Papal Count if he would part with a
"Flight into Egypt" known as the Wertz
Raphael. But of course even a knighthood
is better than a Papal Count, and if Mr.
Wertz gives his Holbeins to the National
Gallery he is sure to be created something.</p>

<p>You cannot be too careful of the unmarried
girls you know; Miss La Touche is
certainly not the sort of person for you to
be intimate with. The Rooses, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
are quite correct, they will make capital
foils for you; beside Jane Roose is amiable,
and has been out so many seasons that her
advice will be useful. Be sure, however, to
do the very opposite to what she tells you.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lady Beatrice Carterville</i></div>

<p>If the weather is fine to-morrow, I am
going to drive over in the afternoon to call
on Lady Beatrice Carterville. She has a
house-party, and the people who come to
her are sure to be odd and amusing. My
neuralgia has been better these last few
days. The things I ordered from Paquin
have come at last; the mauve cr&ecirc;pe de
chine with the valenciennes lace flounces is
lovely; the hat and parasol are creations, as
the Society papers say. Love to Lady
Cecilia and the tips of my fingers to Sir
Trevor.&mdash;Your dearest Mamma.</p>

<h2>LETTER II</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Monk's Folly</span>, 29th July</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lady Beatrice's Tea</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;felt</span> so well yesterday that I drove over
in the afternoon to Lady Beatrice's to
tea. I felt I must show myself as Paquin
made me to someone. It was so warm that
tea was served on the terrace; the view of the
Quantocks steaming in the distance over the
tops of the oaks in the park was charming.
There were a great many people present,
and when I arrived, Lady Beatrice exclaimed
at the courage I showed in coming when the
sun was so hot and the road so dusty. She
presided at the tea-table in white piqu&eacute; and
a sailor hat which rested on the bridge of her
nose. She is as fat as Lady Theodosia
Doran and plays tennis; the rouge on her
neck had stained her collar, quite a four-inch
collar too, and there were finger marks
of rouge on her bodice. She introduces
everybody, which, while it is not the thing,
certainly makes one more comfortable than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the fashion at present in vogue. I always
like to know the names of the people I am
talking to. Everybody talked about the
weather and the dust, and it was deadly dull
till Lady Beatrice said she wanted to play
tennis. She went off to play singles with
Mr. Frame, the Low Church curate, and
looked so funny, bounding about the lawn
like a big rubber ball, that I nearly screamed.
Most of the people strolled up and down
the terrace, or leaned over the balustrade
above the lake. I sat under my parasol in
a Madeira chair, and was talked to by such
a curious woman, a Mrs. Beverley Fruit.
<span class="sidenote"><i>A Live Authoress</i></span>It was interesting to meet a real live
authoress after having read her works. I
remember when Mrs. Fruit's first novel
came out ten years ago it created a great
sensation, but I must confess the sensation
was confined to middle-class people and the
Universities. Of course, everybody in
Society bought it. It was all about Radicals
and a silly Low Church curate who threw up
his living because he didn't believe in God,
and went to London and lived in the slums.
Mr. Gladstone wrote a review of it, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
dramatised it in America. Mrs. Fruit has
since written several other books, and each
one is more bitter against Society than the
last, so you may fancy how nervous I felt
at being left with such a woman. But,
darling, she isn't at all like her books. I
was quite charmed with her; she was dressed
so well, and looked quite like a lady; she
lives in Berkeley Square and has a place in
Essex. In the last election she canvassed
the county for the Conservatives, and the
Duchess of Rougemont is very, very fond
of her. Lady Beatrice tells me that Mrs.
Beverley Fruit's son, who is private secretary
to a Cabinet Minister, is actually going
to marry one of the Duchess's daughters,
Lady Mabel, the one with the projecting teeth
and the squint. And I am sure I think it
is very brave of Mr. Fruit Junior, for Lady
Mabel is both ugly and stupid. However,
the connection is a good one for the Fruits,
who have made their fortune out of books,
which I think is decidedly less vulgar than
pale ale or furniture. Mrs. Fruit is staying
with Lady Beatrice.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lady Ann Fairfax</i></div>

<p>Lady Ann Fairfax, the <i>Daily Sensation's</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
War correspondent, is also stopping at
Braxome Towers. She told me that she
had been through three sieges, and never
felt happier than when "sniping," whatever
that may be. She lived three months in a
bomb-proof shelter on quarter rations, was
once taken prisoner, and when exchanged
was sent through the lines barefoot and
with only a blanket round her. She is
bringing out a book to be called "What I
have been through," and I shall certainly
buy it. She is rather pretty and dresses
beautifully, and is very amusing; you could
listen to her for hours; her stories are like
shilling shockers, with a bit of Henty thrown
in to give them style. She was quite breezy,
and I was sorry when Lady Beatrice shouted
triumphantly, "Six love, Mr. Frame!"
and came up puffing like a porpoise, her
hair soppy on the temples and gutters on
her cheeks.</p>

<p>Lady Beatrice was in an awfully good
humour, for Mr. Frame beat the Somerset
champion last week, but, poor man! he
would not dare to even dream of beating
Lady Beatrice. She only suffers him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
eat her cucumber sandwiches and drink her
Mazawattee for the pleasure of beating
him.</p>

<p>The drive home in the twilight was very
pleasant. I brought Captain Bennett of the
Coldstreams and the Earl of Mortimer as
far as the Club in Taunton. They are playing
for Gloucester, but, as I dislike cricket
as much as you do, I shan't go to see the
match. I know my frock was admired at
Braxome to-day; poor Mr. Frame, who sat
and ate ices near me after his thrashing,
would never meet my glance directly, and I
overheard Lady Beatrice tell Mrs. Beverley
Fruit that I spent altogether too much on
dress, while Lady Beatrice always looks as
if she considered the expenditure of a five-pound
note on her person an extravagance.
Dear, dear Paquin!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Missing Handkerchief</i></div>

<p>I am awfully provoked with myself,
the lace handkerchief I wore to-day is
missing. I am sure it was in my hand
when we left Braxome, for I remember
sniffing "parfum d'Arabie" in the carriage.
It is really quite provoking.&mdash;Your dearest
Mamma.</p>

<hr class="tb" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Handkerchief Found</i></div>

<p><i>P. S.</i>&mdash;I have just received a note from
Captain Bennett saying he found my handkerchief
sticking to his coat when he got into
the Club, and asking if he may restore it to
me in person to-morrow.</p>

<h2>LETTER III</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Monk's Folly</span>, 1st August</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Mature Young Man</i></div>

<p class="capd"><i>L<span class="dcap">'ing&eacute;nue</span> va bien.</i> I am so glad
you managed to put that odious
Mrs. Smith in her place. It is really too
revolutionary to be forced to accept such
people, but what you tell me about her
and Lord Valmond surprises me. I can
quite understand a woman of her stamp
liking the admiration of Valmond, for he
is young and good-looking, and a marquis,
but what can he see in her? He is one
of those young men who mature quickly;
at fifteen he could tell whether a woman
put on her chemise or her petticoat first,
and at one and twenty he knew the Rake's
Catechism by heart. But I have always
heard that he was intelligent, and his people
were never afraid of his doing something
foolish. He takes his <i>menus plaisirs</i> like
a gentleman, but why he should be so devoted
to this Mrs. Smith I cannot conceive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
She is not pretty, she is not witty; Lord
Valmond is rich, surely he does not want
to borrow money from her. I shall be
glad when you leave Nazeby Hall; it is
one thing to catch a marquis, and another
thing to get scratched in the effort. You
must leave at once, otherwise you will be
forced to play your trump card&mdash;the art
of being an <i>ing&eacute;nue</i>. Leave at once, Valmond
will be sure to follow. The slap on
the cheek was excellent; no man ever forgets
a woman who has left the print of her
fingers on his face, he will either hate her
or love her. If the man <i>is</i> a man and was
in the wrong, he will be forced to admire
the woman who could protect herself against
him. Leave Nazeby, Elizabeth; Valmond
is a man and a gentleman, let him know
that you are a lady and virtuous.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Handkerchief Returned</i></div>

<p>This morning, just before lunch, Fifine
and I were dozing on the lawn under the
big Japanese umbrella, when James came
to tell me that Captain Bennett was in the
drawing-room. Of course he came to return
my handkerchief&mdash;it was very polite
of him to bring it himself, especially as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
he rode all the way from Taunton in a
blazing sun, along a road lying under nearly
a foot of dust. Naturally, I could not let
him go back without lunch, and afterwards,
when I thought he would go, he asked me
to let him look over my songs, as he
wanted something to sing at a smoker to-night,
which the Yeomanry are giving for
him and the Earl of Mortimer. He tried
nearly all, and tea was brought in before
he got one to suit his voice, which is really
<span class="sidenote"><i>Captain Bennett</i></span>a very good one. He is a very gentlemanly
man, and has a shy way of looking at
one, that is quite na&iuml;ve in a soldier. He
wouldn't believe me when I told him I
had a daughter seventeen, until I showed
him your photograph. He seemed so astonished
that I was obliged to tax him
with being extremely ungallant. I asked
him if he expected a woman to be old at
thirty-five because she happened to marry
at seventeen, and he gave me such a look
that I felt quite uncomfortable. His eyes
were not at all shy, but looked like sparks
of blue fire. Just then there was the sound
of a carriage driving up, and Mrs. Chevington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and the Blaine girls rushed into the
room. Fell in would be more correct, for
so few Englishwomen know how to enter a
room quickly and gracefully. They didn't
know Captain Bennett, and as I thought
I had had enough of him for one day, I
wouldn't introduce him.</p>

<p>He has a horrid way of shaking hands,
and left the print of my opal ring on my
middle finger. I told him to keep the songs
as long as he wished, but he is so awfully
polite he said he would return them to-morrow.
When he had gone, Daisy Blaine
asked me if I had heard that he said in the
Taunton Club he intended to marry money,
which I thought very spiteful of her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chevington was greatly agitated by
the report that an American family have
taken Astley Court. She said that everybody
is asking Lady Beatrice Carterville if
she is going to call on them. I believe, if
Lady Beatrice should marry Mr. Frame,
Mrs. Chevington would find an excuse for
her. Whenever she passes the lions at
Braxome Lodge, Mrs. Chevington is pervaded
with the most sacred emotions&mdash;she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
has admitted as much to me. There are
some people to whom blue blood is more
intoxicating than champagne, and who look
on a pedigree as a reservoir which you can
never exhaust. The odd part of it is, that
Mrs. Chevington is not a snob, she is merely
common or garden respectable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Ghost</i></div>

<p>The Blaine girls asked a great many
questions about you, and if it was true that
the ghost walked every night at Nazeby
(Mrs. Chevington had told them about your
letter which I read to her). Blanche Blaine
said she wouldn't visit such a house as
Nazeby for all the possible husbands it might
contain, which I think was rude of her, but
admitted, when I seemed cross, that once
she had a similar experience at Great Ruin
Castle. Her adventure was more sensational
than yours, for Mrs. Maltravers, who had
the room next to her, told her their corridor
was haunted and that several people who
on hearing noises had come out of their
rooms to see what it was, had gone mad.
But the ghost has yet to walk who can
frighten Blanche Blaine. Immediately after
Mrs. Maltravers, who had seen Blanche into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
her bed-room to reassure her, she said, had
kissed her good-night and left, Blanche
opened her door softly and peeped cautiously
into the corridor, and while she looked she
distinctly saw the ghost advancing towards
her; and the ghost carried a candle in one
hand, and wore crimson plush knee-breeches
and white stockings and its hair was powdered.
And while Blanche was uncertain
whether to scream or faint the ghost vanished
into Mrs. Maltravers' room. Blanche said
she waited to hear Mrs. Maltravers scream,
but as not a sound came from her room,
Blanche believed her imagination had got
the better of her, so she bolted her door and
went to bed.</p>

<h2>LETTER IV</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Monk's Folly</span>, 3rd August</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Parkers Arrive</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">Mrs. Chevington</span> walked over
yesterday before tea expressly to
tell me, she said, that Mr. Phineas T. Parker
and family, of New York, had arrived
at Astley Court, having travelled down from
London in a special Pullman attached to
the Bristol express. I saw two of them this
morning in Taunton going into St. Mary's
with Baedekers, and Lady Beatrice called on
them this afternoon, and by the end of the
month the Parkers will be a county family.
They are fabulously rich; I forget how
many hundred million dollars Mr. Parker
is worth, and of course nobody asks how he
made his money. Algy says they are all
kings in America and it doesn't matter, but
as for that it doesn't matter in England
either, where at the most the millionaires
are only barons.</p>

<p>Nobody can talk of anything but their
arrival, and everybody is singing Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Beatrice's praises for having called on them
so soon. Captain Bennett, who came this
afternoon to bring back the songs and
stupidly left two behind, says she should be
canonised. Mr. Parker and his son have
already been proposed and seconded at the
Taunton Club; they have been asked to
dine at the mess on guest-night; and both
Father Ribbit and Mr. Frame, the High
Church rector and Low Church curate, have
offered them pews under the pulpit, and
asked them to subscribe respectively to the
Convent School of the Passionate Nuns and
the Daily Soup Dispensary. But rumour
has it that the Parkers are Baptists, and are
going to the chapel in Holmes' the grocer's
back-yard. I shall drive Mrs. Chevington
over to Astley to-morrow and leave your
card with mine.</p>

<p>On coming home from Taunton this
morning, Perkins drove by Braxome. You
know part of the road runs through the
park, and I saw Lady Beatrice's equestrian
cook out for an airing on a brown cob, with
a couple of Gordon setters sniffing its hoofs.
She really looked quite lady-like. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Chevington says her habit was made at
Redfern's. Lady Beatrice found her in the
Want column of the <i>Standard</i>.</p>

<p>"Young woman desires situation in
County Family, as cook, housemaid, or
companion; cook preferred. Must have
use of horse daily. Highest references."</p>

<p>Lady Beatrice is delighted with her, and
she will hunt with the West Somerset Harriers
this coming season.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Captain Bennett Dislocates his Thumb</i></div>

<p>Captain Bennett dislocated his thumb at
cricket to-day, and is <i>hors de combat</i> for the
rest of the match. When he came back
with the songs this afternoon he was suffering
such pain that he asked me if I would
mind putting on a fresh bandage for him.
I told him that the sight of blood always
made me faint, but he assured me the skin
was not broken, so I took off the old bandage
and put on a new one. It seemed to
give him great relief, and he said I would
make a splendid nurse, and looked at me
with that queer blue fire look his eyes always
have, when their expression is not as timid
as a bashful boy's. He is awfully stupid at
conversation, and one has to do all the talking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
I asked him if they fed him properly
at the Club, for he always looked so hungry
whenever I met him. He replied that he
was literally starving, but that nothing so
material as food would satisfy his hunger,
and that blue fire look came back into his
eyes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Captain Bennett in Delirium</i></div>

<p>I thought he was becoming delirious from
the pain of his thumb, and I begged him to
go home and send for the doctor. Then he
did so strange a thing that I am sure it was
done in delirium; he asked me to feel how
fast his pulse was beating&mdash;it went tick-tock
like a Waterbury watch&mdash;and he put his
arm with the bad thumb round my waist,
and called me an angel in the back of his
throat and was hot all over. So I knew he
had fever. I wasn't a bit afraid, for I have
wonderful presence of mind, as you know.
I have been told it is best to humour people
in delirium, so I said I was sure I was an
angel, for everybody told me so, and that if
he would kindly stop crushing the jet
spangles on my cream-coloured crepon
bodice I would act like an angel to him.
He instantly obeyed, and I rose and rang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
for James and told him that Captain Bennett
was too ill to ride back to Taunton. Whereupon,
before I could finish speaking, James
asked if he should tell Perkins to get ready
the brougham or dog-cart, and if I thought
a glass of barley-water would do Captain
Bennett good.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An Ideal Servant</i></div>

<p>Such a treasure, James. Really an ideal
servant; knows exactly what one wants
without one's having the trouble to order it.
I can't understand how Lord Froom parted
with him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Monsieur Malorme</i></div>

<p>Just then Monsieur Malorme, whom the
Blaines have engaged to talk French with
Bertie before he joins the Embassy in Paris,
came over with a note from Blanche asking
me to a garden party on Saturday. I made
Captain Bennett drink the barley-water,
which I think must have done him good,
because he sat very quiet till James came to
say Perkins was ready. Monsieur Malorme
is a very good-looking young man for a
Frenchman, almost as good-looking as
Captain Bennett; he has beautiful teeth and
hands, but a horrid way of looking out of
his eyes, as if he had just winked at you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
He is a Proven&ccedil;al and quite a gentleman;
Blanche said they felt obliged to have him
eat with them, for he was very superior and
accustomed to the best society. When he
was coaching the Duke of FitzArthur he
always followed the Melton Mowbray pack,
and took the Dowager Duchess in to dinner
when the family were alone.</p>

<p>I found him quite entertaining and he
made Captain Bennett laugh quite naturally,
so I knew the barley-water had acted, and
I said so. I told Captain Bennett that I
would send a groom into Taunton with his
horse, and he could take that opportunity to
return the rest of my songs, if he had done
with them. When he went away, he gave
me such a blue fire look and squeezed my
hand so horridly that I thought he was
going to be delirious again.</p>

<p>Remembering what Blanche had said of
Monsieur Malorme's superiority, I took an
interest in his pursuits, asked him how long
he had been in England, what he thought
of our customs, and if he found Bertie an
apt pupil. He replied that he had been a
year in England, that he found life in Grosvenor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Square <i>plus ravissante qu'&agrave; Paris</i>, and
that the English women were <i>comme les volcanes
ayant leurs cimes dans la neige</i>, and that
Bairtee was <i>pr&eacute;coce</i>, which I knew was a horrid
French lie, for you know it is only because
Mrs. Blaine's uncle is in the Cabinet
that Bertie, whose chin and forehead seem
to be racing to see which can get away from
the other the fastest, ever got that secretaryship
in the Rue St. Honor&eacute;.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Phonograph</i></div>

<p>James brought in whiskey and soda and
cigarettes, and Monsieur Malorme, who is
really quite amusing, became communicative.
He assured me that Daisy Blaine
was something for which there seems to be
no word in French, for he substituted as an
equivalent a gesture made by putting the
thumb and forefinger to the lips and wafting
a kiss into the air. I also gathered that he
was at work on a French-English grammar,
which was to revolutionise all methods of
teaching at present in vogue. It seems that
Monsieur Malorme speaks the grammar
into phonographs, and one buys the phonograph
instead of the book. Lord St. Noodle
is quite delighted with the idea, and has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
promised to speak into the phonograph
before the grammar begins; and Monsieur
Malorme hopes to persuade the French
Ambassador and the Chancellor of the Exchequer
to recommend it in the same way.
To overcome the difficulty of speaking into
each phonograph separately, Monsieur Malorme
proposes to hire a room and fill it with
phonographs, so that all will catch the voice
at the same time. He grew quite <i>farouche</i>
over it, and let one of my Bohemian goblets,
which contained his whiskey and soda, fall
and break. And he looked at me like Captain
Bennett when the delirium was coming
on, so I excused myself as having to dress
for dinner, and left James to show him out.
I expect to hear from you at Heaviland
Manor to-morrow. I feel sure Lord Valmond
will follow you, for he has a place
near, which makes the excuse very plausible.&mdash;Your
dearest Mamma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Dinner-party</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">Last</span> night Lady Beatrice gave a dinner
for the Parkers. I wore the blue brocade
with the Peter Lely bodice, and that
odious Mr. Rumple took me in. I am sure
Lady Beatrice decided on it at the last moment
to spite me, because she overheard me
ask Mr. Frame how such a champion as he
liked being beaten by her ladyship every day.
Captain Bennett sat on the other side of me
and Mr. Frame was opposite, so I devoted
myself entirely to them, and left Mr. Rumple
to lap up his soup like a horse in a water-trough.
Society is falling off terribly now-a-days;
we are no longer county but provincial
families. I really don't see why because Mr.
Rumple is Lady Beatrice's lawyer that she
should invite him to dine when she has a
party, but of course we have no really smart
set down here, and one sends into Taunton for
a lawyer or a doctor to fill up a vacant place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
at a dinner-table, just as one sends in for meat
or candles. Mr. Rumple is fat and pasty,
and has a beard; his only topics of conversation
were the assizes and the war. I asked
him why he didn't volunteer, and he looked
at me with a Dover to Calais smile, and
said what did I think would become of his
practice. And I replied, "I believe you are
a Pro-Boer, Mr. Rumple." He turned
green like a gooseberry, and then purple,
and Lady Beatrice cried sharply, "What is
that you are, Mr. Rumple?" "Pro-Boer,"
he faltered, echoing my words, and everybody
was upon him at once like a pack of wolves.
He isn't really anything of the sort, but a
Tory who believes that because Lady Beatrice
was a duke's daughter she is part of the
Constitution. Algy Chevington says he is
a rising man, but I prefer to know such people
when the process is complete, for this
rising is only another term for moulting,
which is decidedly unpleasant to witness in
the male species of the respectable middle-class.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room, before the men
joined us, Mrs. Parker sang "The Star-Spangled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Banner" and "Marching through
Georgia," and Lady Beatrice actually joined
in the chorus. Mrs. Parker's dress was <i>not</i>
made at Paquin's, and she only wore one
decent ring. Miss Parker, however, kept
up the family's reputation for wealth, and
wore ropes of diamonds round her neck,
which made poor Lady Beatrice in her black
and yellow satin and amethysts look positively
dowdy. Mr. Parker <i>p&egrave;re</i> is, I think,
inclined to be jovial if he got the chance.
He has small bright eyes, and has lost two
fingers on his left hand in the course of his
"rising" process. He called me madam
continually, and asked me if I thought Lady
Beatrice would ever marry, which struck me
as so absurd that I laughed outright. "Do
you want her for your son?" I said. "God
forbid!" he replied, and I thought he was
going to poke me in the waist with one of
the stumps of his right hand.</p>

<p>Lady Beatrice, as you know, would have
fifty fits of the most violent epileptic form
if a woman attempted to smoke in her
presence, and as I saw Blanche Blaine walking
up and down on the terrace with a cigar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
in her cheek I was on the point of joining
her when I remembered my neuralgia, but I
sent Mr. Parker out to her as he said he
found it "darned poky" to have to listen
to his wife's voice.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Captain Bennett Apologises</i></div>

<p>Captain Bennett at once took the vacant
place, and began to apologise most profusely
for his behaviour two days ago. He looked
really miserable, and there wasn't any more
blue fire in his eyes. He has to go back to
Windsor to-morrow, and I shan't see him
again. He wanted to know if I was sorry
and if I would let him come back, and then
to my amazement he declared he loved me.
It was a most unfair advantage, and I told
him so; we were sitting in the middle of
Lady Beatrice's drawing-room. Mr. Frame
and Lady Beatrice were looking at us as hard
as they could, and I am sure Daisy Blaine
heard every word he said. I begged him to
stop, but he said recklessly he didn't care if
the whole room heard; that I had encouraged
<span class="sidenote"><i>Captain Bennett's Threat</i></span>him and broken his heart. He had
never loved a woman before, and if I
wouldn't have him he was going to hell,
and it would all be at my door. I think it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
was villainously low down of him, and at
that moment I would have preferred Mr.
Rumple to be sitting next me. I got up to
go away, but he had hold of my skirt and
said I should hear him out, and as I didn't
care to leave yards of Paquin in his hands
I submitted. Captain Bennett is a perfect
brute, and I am sure he had drunk too
much of Lady Beatrice's champagne. And
to think how deceived I had been in him!
I thought him such a nice, manly young
fellow, with such good manners, and such a
straight back and long legs, so smart and
handsome; and he was so insulting and
threatening, and had hold of my skirt so
that I couldn't budge. How I hate him.
As if I would ever dream of marrying a
<i>parvenu</i>, even if his fortune would build
a line of battle ships. When he finally let
me move, he said he was going back to
Windsor to blow out his brains. I told
him with my sweetest smile, for Lady
Beatrice scented something and was glaring
at me, that if I were he I would do something
original, and that I was sure he hadn't
a bit of originality about him, for he talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">"<i>Family Herald</i>"</span>just like the <i>Family Herald</i>. He laughed
and said he would like to choke me, and
that I had not seen the last of him, and he
would have me on my knees at his feet
yet. A really horrid young man. I wish
he would go to South Africa; I am sure
nobody would miss him.&mdash;Your dearest
Mamma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Graftons</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;felt</span> particularly virtuous this morning,
and drove over to Romford to see
old Admiral and Mrs. Grafton. Such a
dear Darby and Joan pair, so different from
the foot-in-the-grave old couples one meets
now-a-days. The Admiral was pruning roses
in the dearest little garden when I drove
up; he hobbled up with a wheeze and
muddy fingers and opened the carriage door
before Alfred had time to dismount from the
box. He welcomed me to Romford with
an old-school bow, and gave me an elbow
to shake because his hands were full of
lumps of Somersetshire clay. He asked
me to sit down in the dining-room (they
always shut up the drawing-room in the
summer, and it is as damp as a church),
while he called his wife. Mrs. Grafton,
who is a dear, kissed me on both cheeks,
and asked after my neuralgia and you. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
it was awfully hot, she was wearing
the Queen's Indian shawl; they keep the
rooms so dark that I nearly sat down on
the Angora cat, which was sleeping in the
most comfortable chair in the room. While
the Admiral was washing his hands and
choking with asthma in the next room,
Mrs. Grafton told me about the rheumatism
in her left shoulder, and that she had
thought at first that I was the chiropodist
they were expecting from Taunton.</p>

<p>They insisted on my seeing the kitchen
garden, and were very proud that their
Brussels sprouts took the first prize at the
Bath Vegetable Show in the Spring. I saw
the pigs being fed, and the Admiral told me
that one of his sows had been given him by
the Dowager Marchioness of Ealing, who
had brought it to him in her arms wrapped
in cotton-wool when it was a week old.
The Admiral amuses himself with carpentering,
and has had one of the conservatories
fitted up as a tool-house, but since
he mistook one of his thumbs for a shaving
and nearly planed it off, he hasn't been able
to finish the table for the butler's pantry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Mrs. Grafton made him show me his artificial
ice-machine, and he frapp&eacute;ed a Veuve
Clicquot for me, but the vacuum or something
didn't work and the neck of the
bottle broke. Then we went back to the
dining-room, where the Angora cat was
sharpening its claws in the lace curtains.
The Admiral said, "Damn that beast,
Maria!" but Mrs. Grafton gave him such
a look, and said, "Oh, Arthur! how can
you when he has been so ill lately. Puss,
puss, purr-r, purr-r."</p>

<p>A servant brought in some port wine
and biscuits, and the Admiral asked me if
I cared to see his views of places on the
Pacific station. We came to a photograph
of a woman in a mantilla, whom the Admiral
said was the belle of Lima, and he
sighed and chuckled. "Those were days
to remember; we were the fastest ship in
the Navy, and when we went out of commission
there wasn't a pair of black eyes
from Valparaiso to Vancouver that didn't
shed tears." Then Mrs. Grafton told me
of the voyage she made out to the station,
when she was the only woman on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
steamer, and how two men quarrelled over
her in Colon harbour, and another threatened
to throw himself in among the man-eaters
at Barbados, because she hadn't
spoken to him for a whole day. The Admiral
looked very savage, and wheezed terribly
and called her Mrs. Grafton. They
were too delightfully Jo Anderson, my jo,
John. I could have spent the whole morning
with them, for it is so refreshing to find
people natural and sincerely attached to each
other. They never spoke a word of scandal
during the whole visit; and when I left,
Mrs. Grafton gave me a beautiful bouquet
of Mar&eacute;chal Niels and said if she were a
man she knew she would break her heart
over me, and the dear old Admiral insisted
on helping me into the carriage and gave
me such a charming Early Victorian salute.</p>

<p>I know they only said nice things of
me when I was out of sight, and I wish
there were more people like them in the
county.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Parkers' Dinner-party</i></div>

<p>Blanche Blaine came to tea in the afternoon;
two of her fingers are iodined and
she had a leather strap round her wrist; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
says she sprained her hand at tennis yesterday
and can't grip her racquet. Daisy biked
over to Exeter this morning with Mr. Frame
to represent Taunton in the mixed doubles
and ladies' singles. The Duchess of Windermere
is to give the prizes. Lady Beatrice
is furious because the Committee decided at
the last moment to scratch her name in the
ladies' doubles. I think it is quite time she
gave up tennis, for she can't hit a ball and
disputes every point and looks such a fright.
She was so mad when she heard she had
been scratched, that she refused to go over
to Exeter, or to let any of her house-party
go. The Parkers took a party in a special
Pullman; Blanche thinks they own it, for
they always have it wherever they go. The
Duchess of Windermere has invited them
to sit under the marquee with her.</p>

<p>I was sorry I could not go to their dinner-party
last night. Blanche says it was awfully
well done. The chef from Prince's and an
army of waiters came down from London.
The plate was superb, china was only used
with soup and fruit&mdash;Dresden and S&egrave;vres;
the handles of the knives and forks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
gold, studded with rubies, those of the
spoons were silver and ebony. The favours
must have cost a small fortune. Lady Beatrice,
who went in with Mr. Parker, got a
diamond aigrette; Blanche got two volumes
of Tennyson's poems in calf; there must
have been some mistake in the order, for
there were not enough favours to go round,
and Mr. Rumple, who sat next to Blanche,
found a ten-pound note under the roll in
his napkin.</p>

<p>As usual, Mrs. Parker wore a high-necked
dress and no jewels; Miss Parker was <i>&agrave; la
Paquin</i> and went in to dinner with the Duke
of Clandevil. There was no attempt at precedence,
and Lord Froom was in a towering
rage that Mrs. Parker went in with Mr.
Frame. But I think it was very bad taste
of him, as his favour was a gold watch, with
the Froom crest and motto in diamonds, and
as the Parkers are foreigners and kings in
their own country every excuse should be
made for them.</p>

<p>Clandevil is stopping at Astley Court, and
rumour has it his engagement to Miss Parker
will soon be made public. I pity her, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
she seems a decent sort, and we all know
what the duke is. He is five years younger
than she, and only the ha'penny papers published
his cross-examination in the Ventry
divorce. But I suppose even an American
king's daughter would not refuse an English
duke, and Mrs. Parker was heard to tell
Mr. Frame with a sigh that it would cost
such a lot to stop the leaks in a seven-acre
roof.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mr. Parker Junior</i></div>

<p>Mr. Parker, Junior, is very retiring and
can hardly be got to speak or do anything.
Blanche thinks him stupid, but Mrs. Chevington
says he has what she calls "a head
for business," for he never goes to the
Stock Exchange without causing a panic.
Considering the food and the presents, the
dinner was a huge success, but Mr. Parker
would persist in telling Lady Beatrice how
he had made his money, and that fifty years
ago, "when you and I were young, Lady
Beatrice, I was a barefoot newsboy in
Broadway."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Boys Troublesome</i></div>

<p>You amuse me with your account of the
Westaways. I don't pity Lady Westaway
very much for having such a daughter-in-law;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
if she had used tact with Billy he
would probably have listened to reason. I
am so glad, darling, that you are a girl and
not a boy; boys are such a source of anxiety
in families of our station. They are always
getting into trouble, and they pick up such
vulgar tastes. Why is it, I wonder, that
one never hears of girls marrying beneath
them, but it takes all the ingenuity we possess
to keep the boys out of <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>.
Billy Westaway is a fool, and there are so
many like him.</p>

<p>Between us, I would rather have a son as
bad as Clandevil than one as silly as Billy
Westaway; but if it came to marrying one
of them I should prefer it to be the other
way about.&mdash;Your dearest Mamma.</p>

<h2>LETTER VII</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Hotel National, Lucerne</span><br />
<span class="mr3">18th August</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lucerne</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">How</span> surprised you will be to see the
above address. Blanche Blaine and
I came here on the spur of the moment, the
day after you left for Croixmare.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Glacier Garden</i></div>

<p>Blanche came over in the morning, and
asked me if I would go with her to Lucerne
for a fortnight. The idea struck me as rather
lively, and we went up to London that night
in time to catch the Club train for Paris
the next day. We were lucky to get rooms
at the National, for they are turning people
away to-day. We have apartments on the
second floor, with a lovely view of the lake
and Pilatus; the only blot on the landscape
is the yacht belonging to the hotel. As I
write in my balcony, I can see it over the
tops of the chestnuts on the <i>quai</i> bobbing
alongside of the jetty with a huge "Quaker
Oats" on the sail. The weather is perfect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and the air makes you feel as if you were
breathing champagne. This morning we
went to see the Lion, to get it over as
Blanche said. We saw hundreds in the
shop-windows before we got there, and they
all looked so sorry for themselves, as if they
thought, "We can't help it they made us
like this, go a little higher up and you'll see
the real thing." The real thing is made of
plaster, and you pay fifty centimes to see it
in a <i>boutique</i>, where they sell Swiss quartz
and post-cards. The gigantic thing carved
out of the rock is really quite imposing, but
the crowds vulgarise it so that it no longer
has the atmosphere of meditation and romance
Thorvaldsen meant it to have. A
party of "personally conducteds" were doing
it with Baedekers in their hands and
edelweiss in their hats, and they made such
funny comments, and asked such quaint
questions about it, I am sure that they had
never heard of it before, and most of them
bought post-cards and wrote on them with
stylographs. Then they all went into the
Glacier Garden, and the water was turned
on to show them glacial action on the rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>At Hugenin's</i></div>

<p>On the way back, Blanche and I stopped
at Hugenin's, and had champagne frapp&eacute;
and meringues at a table on the pavement
under an awning, and some people dressed
as Tyrolese peasants yodelled in the garden
of a caf&eacute; across the street. Crowds of people
passed us; some were very smartly dressed,
but most of the women wore bicycle skirts
with buttons in the back and felt hats with
a feather at the side, and carried edelweiss.
Blanche said Continental life made her feel
wicked, and she bought a package of Turkish
cigarettes from such a good-looking
Italian boy, with a performing monkey, and
a basket on his arm filled with post-cards of
the Lion and Pilatus cigarettes. He was
so delighted that he made the monkey go
through his tricks, and some horrid men in
dress suits came and stood about with their
hands in their pockets and no hats on their
heads. I think they must have been waiters,
for presently a gong sounded and they
all bolted into the Lucernerhof. The Italian
boy gave us such a graceful bow when we
went away that Blanche felt sure he was a
Count in disguise. She said she had heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that poor Italian noblemen wandered about
the Continental watering-places in the summer
with monkeys, just like the poor
Baronets who sing Christy Minstrel songs
to banjos on the sands at Brighton, and
that you could always tell them by their
manners. She was sure of it, because Sir
Dennis O'Desmond had told her he had
made quite a lot of money that way one
year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Hungarian Band</i></div>

<p>We got back to the National just in time
to change for lunch. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se had our frocks
and curling-irons ready for us, and was in
such a temper because her meals were not
to be served in her room. We had lunch
in the big <i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i>, which is also the
ball-room; the food was excellent and very
well served; all the people looked smart,
but we didn't know any of them. The
Hungarian band played, and the conductor
was such a handsome man; he wore a blue
jacket trimmed with astrachan and silver
buttons, and black satin knee-breeches with
blue stockings. He was very tall and finely
proportioned, with flashing black eyes and
curly hair. Blanche, who is always jumping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to conclusions, believes he is the man who
eloped with the Princess de Chimay.</p>

<p>After lunch, we had coffee and liqueur
and cigarettes in the hall. The chairs were
luxurious, and as all the doors and windows
were open it was delightfully breezy; there
was no glare, and it was great fun watching
the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Dip in the Lake</i></div>

<p>At three o'clock Blanche went across to
the baths and had a dip in the lake, and I
drew a sofa in front of my balcony and had
a snooze in the shade. When Blanche came
back she said the bathing was perfect, but
that the boards which separated the "Herren"
from the "Frauen" were riddled with
holes, and that as far as privacy was concerned
the two sexes might as well have
bathed together. She insisted on having
tea on the <i>terrasse</i> of the Kursaal where
she heard a band playing. When we got
there the place was deserted save for some
men who were drinking beer at a table with
a very <i>d&eacute;mod&eacute;r</i> woman and little child. We
afterwards recognised them as the croupiers
who ran the Petits Chevaux. Later on all
the tables were taken. The people were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
mostly cheap Germans and Americans, and
they encored the Boer Volkslied which the
orchestra played with great spirit. It was
the first time I had heard the Transvaal
National Anthem. It is like a trek in the
spirit of the Marseillaise; you could hear
the bullock carts rumbling over the veldt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>At the Cathedral</i></div>

<p>At six o'clock we went to the Cathedral
to hear the organ. Every seat was taken,
and the music was superb; the prima donna
from the Dresden Opera sang. The twilight
gradually faded into darkness, and they
didn't light the candles. The effect of the
<i>vox humana</i> was very solemn, and the music
seemed to be far away up in the darkness
like a chorus of angels chanting. I felt
very good.</p>

<p>The smart people were very smart, at
dinner, and all seemed to know one another.
They took the best seats in the verandah
afterwards, and watched the flash-light and
illuminations on the Stanzerhorn. We are
going to spend the day on the lake to-morrow.&mdash;Your
dearest Mamma.</p>

<h2>LETTER VIII</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Hotel National, Lucerne</span><br />
<span class="mr3">20th August</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Flu&euml;len</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">Yesterday</span> Blanche and I went to
Flu&euml;len. The boat was crowded, but
we got two comfortable seats in front of the
wheel and had a perfect view. The scenery
was indescribably lovely, and the air was so
clear that we could actually see the people
walking about on the top of the Rigi.
Some Swiss peasants got on at Brunen, and
they all had goitre; one was such a good-looking
young fellow about twenty; his
neck looked positively uncomfortable, but
he didn't seem to mind it at all. Nearly all
the hotels are du Lac or des Alpes, and have
<i>terrasses</i> planted with chestnuts, and there
was always excitement when the steamer
<span class="sidenote"><i>Bicyclists</i></span>stopped. Two bicycle fiends got off at
Brunen; they were English, and we saw
them afterwards scorching along the Axenstrasse
in clouds of dust, evidently trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to get to Flu&euml;len before us. It seemed so
ludicrous to see bicycles in such a country
as Switzerland, that I told Blanche that I
was sure that people only brought them
there out of a sort of bravado, and that they
didn't really enjoy themselves. An American
who was sitting near, overheard, and
said in quite an offended way that he had
biked over the Brunig from Interlaken to
Lucerne, and was going over the Furka in
the same manner. I replied, I believed if
there was a road to the top of Titlis one
would find a pair of knickerbockers astride
a pneumatic trying to make the ascent. He
smiled contemptuously, and said it was evident
I had never ridden. I told him I had
tried to learn, and had bought an Elswick,
but that the day it arrived a new stable-boy
rode it into Taunton without my knowledge,
and punctured the tire, which was a blessing
in disguise if it had saved me from
making an exhibition of myself on a Swiss
pass. He became quite talkative after this,
and pointed out a great many things of
interest like a Baedeker, without the bother
of having to find the places. We saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Tellsplatte and chapel, and the American
told us that there were as many arrows that
had killed Gessler in various parts of Switzerland
as bits of the True Cross in European
churches. We thought of returning in the
same steamer and having lunch on board,
but he told us we ought to go to Altdorf
and see the new Tell monument, and that
we could get lunch at an inn there. So we
thought while we were about it we might as
well do all there was to be done, and return
by a later boat.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>At Flu&euml;len</i></div>

<p>At Flu&euml;len we had great difficulty in
getting seats in any of the brakes that run
to Altdorf, as everybody made a rush for
them at once. However, Blanche got a bit
of iron bar on the box-seat, and was held
on by a German with an alpenstock and
edelweiss, who linked his arm in hers, while
I was smothered between a Cook's guide,
who looked fagged out, and a garrulous
female, who told me she came from Chicago
and had been hungry ever since she left.
She said they didn't know how to make
pie in Europe, and had never heard of it;
her family seemed specially addicted to pie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and greatly missed this delicacy on their
travels. She had a letter that morning from
her son, a portion of which she read to me:
he was doing the capitals of Europe in three
weeks, and had been fortunate in finding pie
in Constantinople, quite an American pie,
only it was made of pumpkin instead of
Howard squash.</p>

<p>Our brake stopped at a des Alpes, and
the proprietor came out and made us welcome
in the fashion they have on the Continent,
as if he were playing the host in a
private house. My Chicago acquaintance
at once asked for the <i>menu</i>, and you should
have seen her face when she found there
was no pie on it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An Omelette Souffl&eacute;e</i></div>

<p>As I was very hungry, I had the <i>table
d'h&ocirc;te</i> lunch, which was very good, but
Blanche ordered hers <i>&agrave; la carte</i>. The only
French thing on the <i>menu</i> that Blanche
fancied was <i>omelette souffl&eacute;e</i>. It took twenty
minutes to make, and when it came it looked
like a mountain. I told Blanche they must
have thought her capacity enormous, but
when she put her spoon into it, it gave a sort
of sigh and collapsed, and before Blanche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
could get it on her plate there was only as
much as you scrape up in a table-spoon.</p>

<p>As the <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i> courses were all consumed
and time was pressing, she had to content
herself with French rolls and honey.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Tell Monument</i></div>

<p>Before we left Altdorf the two Englishmen
whom we had seen scorching over the
Axenstrasse arrived. I never saw such objects,
they were fairly reeking with perspiration
and covered in white dust. They
looked positively filthy. I heard one asking
the proprietor of the hotel if he could
buy a valve in Altdorf, and they both abused
the Swiss roads as if they had expected to
find them like the Macadam in Hyde Park.
The Tell monument was quite worth coming
to see, but I think its situation in the
tiny <i>platz</i> of the picturesque village, which
the immense mountains seem ready to
crush, makes it more imposing than it really
is. I am sure if it were in a city one would
hardly notice it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Bunch of Edelweiss</i></div>

<p>Blanche was awfully "Cooky," and bought
two post-cards with it on to send to Daisy
and Mrs. Chevington. At Flu&euml;len, too, she
bought a bunch of edelweiss from a Swiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
doll with goitre, and stuck it into the bow
on her sailor-hat. We were quite tired
when we got back to Lucerne, and had
dinner in our rooms, for Th&eacute;r&egrave;se had gone
to bed with a <i>migraine</i> and neglected to put
out our frocks or have our baths ready. I
expect to hear from you to-morrow, and
that you are enjoying yourself at Croixmare.&mdash;Your
dearest Mamma.</p>

<h2>LETTER IX</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Hotel National, Lucerne</span><br />
<span class="mr3">22nd August</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>On the Quai</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">This</span> morning between twelve and one,
Blanche and I were strolling on the
<i>quai</i> when we met Sir Charles Bevon. He
seemed glad to see us, and asked if we knew
any of the people in society here, and when
we told him we had only been in Lucerne
four days and that he was the first person we
had met that we knew, he invited us to dine
with him at the Schweitzerhof to-night. It
is from this dinner we have just come, and I
must tell you about it before I go to bed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Anglophobia</i></div>

<p>Sir Charles asked the Marquis and the
Marquise de Pivart, the Vicomte de Narjac,
and Mr. Vanduzen, an American naval officer
<i>en retraite</i>, to meet us. I sat between the
Marquis and Mr. Vanduzen. The Marquis
looks like a little black monkey, with a beard
<i>&agrave; Henri Deux</i>, but his manners are so elegant
one never thinks of his looks. He knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the De Croixmares very well, and when I
asked him what he thought of H&eacute;loise he
turned so red and looked so uncomfortable
that I at once felt that Jean's charming Comtesse
had <i>bris&eacute; son c&#339;ur</i> at some period of
their acquaintance. He dropped the subject
as soon as possible, and quite rudely began
to talk of the war, and said that England
was the Jew among nations. I cooled his
Anglophobia for him by remarking that I
would much prefer to have him talk of the
Comtesse de Croixmare than attack my country.
He seemed positively afraid of me
after that, so I am sure there must be something
between him and H&eacute;loise that he doesn't
want his wife to know. He got so moody
and silent that I told him I thought him very
rude, and devoted myself through the rest of
dinner to Mr. Vanduzen, who is elderly and
"natty." Mr. Vanduzen is quite amusing,
but I wish he wouldn't call people by their
full names as if they were a species he was
labelling for a museum, such as, "Really,
Miss Blanche Blaine, you amaze me." "It
was very warm to-day, was it not, Madame
la Marquise de Pivart?" "Have you made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the ascent of Pilatus, Sir Charles Bevon?"
You know the style of man, Elizabeth, you
must have met one or two like him at
Nazeby or Hazeldene. If they are English
they are called snobs, but when they come
from the Land of Canaan on the other side
of the pond they are put down quite likely
as "so American."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Marquise</i></div>

<p>The Marquise is a fascinating creature, she
knows the full value of her figure as one of
her attractions, and she clothes it accordingly.
Her bust is like alabaster, the neck and
shoulders are perfect; her eyes are rather
wide apart, which gives her a na&iuml;ve expression;
her smile is simplicity itself, and she
talks with a tabloid voice. Sir Charles
seemed to admire her, for he addressed
nearly all his conversation to her, and he
poked me so hard under the table once or
twice that I was compelled to say, "The
table leg is on the other side, Sir Charles,"
and he gave the Marquise such a reproachful
glance.</p>

<p>Blanche had the Vicomte all to herself, and
he seemed to like it. He has an automobile
and talked of nothing else, and Sir Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
says he does nothing else in Paris. He is
going to take Blanche and the Marquise in it
to-morrow for a spin in the valley of the
Reuss.</p>

<p>Everybody talked at once, as they always
do on the Continent, and the effort to be
general was quite fatiguing to me who am
accustomed to the English method of monopolising
one's neighbours. The foreign
custom certainly gives more "go" to a
dinner, but I think when I am not the hostess
I prefer conversation <i>&agrave; deux</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Don Carlos</i></div>

<p>After dinner we had coffee in the salon
instead of outside on the verandah, for Sir
Charles said we ought to see Don Carlos
and suite go in to dinner. The suite were
already in the salon, and they occupied the
most comfortable chairs and looked rather
sulky, which I suppose was from having to
wait so long for their dinner. Don Carlos
has thirty rooms on the first floor, but he
will neither take his meals in private or at
the usual hour with everybody else. He
makes quite a point of dinner, and has it in
the <i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i> when the general public
have finished. He must be a great advertisement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
for the Schweitzerhof, for crowds
come nightly to see him and the Duchess
go in to dinner. When they entered the
salon there was as much etiquette among
the suite as if they were at a <i>lev&eacute;e</i>. They
formed themselves in a line in order of precedence;
the men all kissed the Duchess's
hand and the ladies curtseyed, then Don
Carlos gave his arm to his wife and led the
way to dinner. As the door of the <i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i>
was open we could see them eating;
everybody talked at once, and the suite ate
as if it was the only dinner they had had for
a week. I am sure they were hungry.</p>

<p>Don Carlos is a splendid-looking Spaniard,
with exile written all over him; whether
natural or cultivated, the pose was perfect&mdash;the
sadness and abstraction, the forced
amusement, the far-away look in the eyes&mdash;but
it wasn't melodramatic, and you
didn't feel like laughing. The Duchess of
Madrid was <i>reine aux bouts des ongles</i> and an
ideal consort for a banished monarch. She
must have been very beautiful at one period
of her life, and is still strikingly fine-looking.
She was dressed as the great ladies on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Continent know how to dress, and wore
some lovely diamonds. She had the same
melancholy far-away expression as Don
Carlos, and they both seemed rather bored,
as if they had had too much of the suite,
who are really nothing but pensioners. Sir
Charles says they have not a peseta to bless
themselves with, and live entirely on the
bounty of Don Carlos. They follow him
wherever he goes and form a sort of court
for him; they are nothing but a pack of
conspirators and professional revolutionists
who dare not go back to Spain, and as they
have all been broken in the Carlist cause,
and still continue to intrigue and make themselves
useful, Don Carlos has to put up with
them. And I must say I think he does it
right royally, keeping up a fine old Bourbon
custom, for these people can still say, like
the needy noblesse in Louis XIV.'s time,
that they "bank with the king."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Kursaal</i></div>

<p>When we had "done" Don Carlos and
his dinner-party, Sir Charles suggested that
we should go to the Kursaal and try our
luck at Petits Chevaux. We found the
room crowded, and most of the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
looked like those I saw at the Monico in
London the night Algy Chevington took
me there for supper, when he couldn't get
a table at the Trocadero. At first we
couldn't get near the tables, but the Marquise
went and stood behind the croupier,
and got him a place for her. Then a man,
who I am sure was a High Church curate,
for he had cut off his coat collar and let his
hair grow long like a French abb&eacute;, offered
me his seat if I would touch his money for
him. But he gave me bad luck till he was
cleared out, and then I began to win. It
was such fun, and I raked in quantities of
gold and some five-franc pieces made of
lead. The Marquise and I won, but the
others had no luck, and I saw the Marquis
somewhere in the back drinking beer with
an impossible female, and I told him so
afterwards, and that I thought it was very
rude to the ladies in his party, and he looked
as if he would like to choke me. The
Vicomte told Blanche that he believed the
croupier tampered with the machinery and
could make any horse win he liked, and the
croupier heard. For an instant I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
there was going to be a "scene," but the
Marquise said such a <i>cochon</i> as the croupier
wouldn't dare to strike the Vicomte, who it
seems spends the time he can spare from
automobiling in Paris in duelling. "Mais,
comme il est sale, ce croupier," the Marquise
said to me, and then added that the croupiers
at Monte Carlo were as beautiful as Lucifer,
and that a friend of hers, a Comtesse Jean
d'Outremer, had eloped with one. A <i>b&ecirc;tise</i>
she called it. I told Sir Charles after that
that I thought we had better go, and they all
walked with us as far as the National. The
Marquis and the Vicomte kissed my hand,
and Sir Charles told me to call on the Marquise
to-morrow, as she expected it. My
kindest regard to Madame de Croixmare
and the family at the ch&acirc;teau.&mdash;Your dearest

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Smart People</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">This</span> morning Blanche and I were sitting
in the wicker chairs under the
chestnuts on the <i>quai</i> in front of the National,
when Sir Charles and the Vicomte
passed. They both stopped and chatted
for a while, then the Vicomte saw some very
smart people who were sitting near and introduced
us to them. They were the Duchesse
de Vaudricourt and Mrs. Wertzelmann,
the wife of the American Minister. The
Duchesse is Empire and the Wertzelmanns
are <i>nouveaux riches</i>, but they are at the very
top of all the society here. A great many
other people came up to speak to them;
Blanche and I were introduced, and, as Sir
Charles said, before you could say "Jack
Robinson" we were <i>rang&eacute;</i>. As we both had on
Paquin we felt quite as well turned out as the
other women, who were beautifully dressed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
You should have seen the people on the
<i>quai</i> stare as they passed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Telling Fortunes</i></div>

<p>Blanche made quite a sensation by telling
fortunes, and everybody wanted their hands
read. She did it awfully well, and told the
right things to the right people. She told
the Duchesse de Vaudricourt, who is fifty if
she is a day, but makes up twenty-five, that
the only tragedy in her life would be her
death, and to beware of a <i>beau sabreur</i> who
carried her photograph in a locket on his
watch chain. When pressed as to the reason
she should be cautious of this unknown,
Blanche told her that he was destined to
perish in a duel over her. The Duchesse
was delighted, for it is said that she longs
for the <i>&eacute;clat</i> of men killing themselves over
her, but that up to the present no one has
ever even fought about her. Mrs. Wertzelmann
was to have her portrait, which has
been painted by Constant, hung in the Luxembourg,
and to marry her daughter to a
Serene Highness, both of which Sir Charles
had told us were her supreme desires. The
Vicomte had a very interesting personality,
and was irresistible with women and greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
respected by men, and was to die in a collision
of automobiles, which made him turn
rather green. Mr. Wertzelmann, the American
Minister, who had joined us, held out
a hand like a working-man's, and asked
Blanche what was going to happen to him.
She said she saw great things in the lines,
and something else which she thought could
only be confided to his ear in private.</p>

<p>He was so excited, and Blanche wrinkled
her eyes at him in the prettiest way, that he
insisted on taking her to the verandah of
the National, and hearing the rest of his
fortune in private. I don't know what
Blanche told him, but he ordered champagne
frapp&eacute;, and when they came back
his face fairly beamed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wertzelmann was very gracious, and
said that though we hadn't called she wanted
us to come out to-morrow afternoon to her
villa to a garden-party; that she hated ceremony
and etiquette and calling, and we
might leave our cards when we came. For
it seems it is the custom here for strangers
to make the first call, but it is really very
silly calling at all, for nobody ever seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
be at home, and one meets the same people
half-a-dozen times a day at the National,
which is the rendezvous of the smart
set.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Comte Belladonna</i></div>

<p>It is the thing to have tea in the garden
of the National, where the Hungarian band
plays from four to six. It is very <i>recherch&eacute;</i>,
and the prices are so high that the <i>canaille</i>,
as the Marquise de Pivart calls the tourists,
don't come. So this afternoon we met the
same set again, and also a dear little old man,
over eighty, who had the most perfect manners,
and was dressed faultlessly. In fact
the Marquise told me that his only occupation
was dressing and paying compliments.
His name is Comte Belladonna, and he has
a face like the carving on a cameo. He
is the most <i>distingu&eacute;</i> person here, and was
something to Victor Emanuel, and has seen
only the best society all his life. He is quite
poor, and has a pension which just about
pays for his gloves and handkerchiefs, but
everybody adores him; he gives tone to
everything, and nothing is complete without
his presence. He is like the old beaux we
used to see at Cannes and Biarritz, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a wonder how at his age he manages to keep
<span class="sidenote"><i>Advertising Custom</i></span>pace with his invitations. Sir Charles says
he has a room on the top floor of the National
which he gets for nothing, for his
name is always put first on the list of the
hotel guests in the papers as an advertisement.</p>

<p>There is an Austrian nobleman at the
Schweitzerhof who is accommodated there
in the same way for the use of his name in
the visitors' list, and I think it is very convenient,
for it saves all the worry of trying
to make ends meet, and one is actually paid
for existing, and supported in the best style.
I am sure if the Irish peers knew that there
was such a custom in vogue they would
move it should be adopted at Scarborough
and Harrogate, and the other places, only,
of course, we haven't any <i>villes de luxe</i> at
home as they have on the Continent.</p>

<p>Comte Belladonna spends his summers at
the National and his winters in Rome, where
the Marquise says the Government, in consideration
for his past services to the State,
have given him a post in a <i>bureau</i>, where all
that he has to do is to occasionally sign his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
name to documents of which he never reads
the contents. He is quite the most youthful
old boy I have ever met; he doesn't
rise at six and walk ten miles before
breakfast like old Lord Merriman, who
hunts with the West Somerset Harriers in
all weathers and golfs on the Quantocks.
Comte Belladonna rises at eleven like a
gilded youth, clothes himself in the most
faultless flannels, and descends to the wicker
chairs under the chestnuts on the <i>quai</i>,
where he reads the "Osservatore Romano,"
and chats with the <i>beau monde</i> of Lucerne
who gather there; at one he lunches like
an epicure, after which he is ready for any
social amusement. He is a charming polished
beau, a master of ceremonies, a courtier,
and he at present affects an American
girl of nineteen, who is quite ready to play
May to his January. But Comte Belladonna
belongs to the country of Machiavelli, and
<i>la belle Am&eacute;ricaine</i> has only her face for her
fortune.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Dinner at a Caf&eacute;</i></div>

<p>To-night we dined at a caf&eacute; with the
Vicomte de Narjac; Sir Charles and the
Wertzelmanns were the only others of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
party. A troupe of Swedish singers sang
and danced and passed round a tambourine,
and after dinner we went to the Kursaal
theatre to see "Puppenfee."&mdash;Your dearest

<h2>LETTER XI</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Hotel National, Lucerne</span><br />
<span class="mr3">26th August</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The De Pivarts' Villa</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">Such</span> a jolly time as we had yesterday!
In the morning before lunch Blanche
and I clambered up the hill behind the
National to call on the De Pivarts. They
live in a mite of a box of a villa. It is at
the end of a street so steep that you feel as
if you were going to pitch head-first down
it when you begin to descend. The De
Pivarts were not at home, according to a
man-servant who came to the door in his
shirt sleeves and without a collar, and took
our cards in fingers that I am sure had
previously been engaged in blacking the
Marquis's boots or lighting the kitchen fire.
But as we came up the hill we saw a man like
the Marquis <i>en d&eacute;shabille</i> leaning out of the
tiny balcony, and we distinctly heard a female
exclaim: "Mon Dieu, je suis perdu! Il n'y
a pas des Geraudels! Marie, vite, vite, descendez
&agrave; la ville pour chercher une bo&icirc;te."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>So we knew where the Marquise got her
voice from.</p>

<p>In spite of the villa being so high up,
the air seemed quite stuffy, for the hill is
full of six-francs-a-day pensions, where there
are enough Baedekers to start a library, and
where they ring <i>ranz des vaches</i> instead of
dinner-gongs.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lunch at the G&uuml;tsch</i></div>

<p>We intended to lunch at the National,
but Sir Charles met us on the <i>quai</i> and said
he had been hunting all over the town for
us, as he wanted us to lunch with him at
the G&uuml;tsch, and go on to the Wertzelmanns'
afterwards. In front of the Schweitzerhof
we found the Vicomte, who had been automobiling
all the morning, and Sir Charles
asked him to join us.</p>

<p>The G&uuml;tsch is much higher than the De
Pivarts' villa, and you reach it by a funicular
which creeps straight up the side of the
hill like a lift. The view was lovely and
so was the cooking; we had a table in front
of a huge window overlooking the <i>terrasse</i>.
Afterwards we strolled in the glades of the
pine forest where the light was like the
pictures called "Studies in Colour," which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
one sees in the Academy and nowhere
else.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Morale of Lucerne Society</i></div>

<p>Blanche and Sir Charles were in front,
while the Vicomte and I, owing to the
Vicomte's laziness, were considerably in the
rear. For once he talked of something else
than his automobile, but his conversation
was not very edifying, save as giving me a
pretty vivid idea of the <i>morale</i> of Lucerne
society. The Vicomte talked the most outrageous
scandal, but in so witty a way that
it was impossible to take offence. He knew
the <i>histoire</i> of everybody, which, if true,
proves that Continental society, especially
at a <i>ville d'eaux</i>, is very much the same as
in English country houses where the people
are smart. As he spoke in French he sailed
straight into the wind, where an Englishman
would have tacked a half-a-dozen times
before reaching port. The voyage was quite
exciting, and when I expected him every
moment to be wrecked on the rocks of a
Moulin Rouge episode he dexterously
dropped anchor in calm water. When we
got back to the G&uuml;tsch I felt as if I had
been listening to one of Gyp's spiciest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
novels in which I knew all the characters.
They manage these things differently in
England, and when Mrs. Smith looks purry-purry,
puss-puss at Lord Valmond you may
be sure that each sees the ghost of a conscience,
and it has the face of Sir Francis
Jeune.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Schloss Gessler</i></div>

<p>From the G&uuml;tsch we went straight to
Schloss Gessler in the Vicomte's automobile.
We tore through Lucerne at top speed; it
was great fun, and the Vicomte said there
was no danger, for the road was straight,
and that nobody would dare get in the way.
Going up the hill outside of the town somebody's
Maltese terrier with bells round its
neck came tearing after us and got under
the wheels. But we didn't stop, and as we
turned into the avenue leading to the Schloss
one of Mr. Wertzelmann's geese committed
suicide by throwing itself in front of the
automobile.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more hospitable
than the welcome the Wertzelmanns gave
us. Everybody we knew was there, and
many more whom we didn't. Mr. Wertzelmann
took me to see the ruins, but all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
is left is a bit of stone wall, which looks as
if it had begun with the intention of encircling
a kitchen-garden, but had decided to
visit the stables, and never got any further.
Mr. Wertzelmann told me it had once sheltered
Gessler, hence the name of the Schloss,
but that the place had recently been restored
by a Swiss engineer who had made a fortune
out of funiculars. Certainly in its present
state Schloss Gessler is very fine, and the
view from the terrace, which Mr. Wertzelmann
insisted were the old battlements, was
lovely.</p>

<p>We saw Mrs. Wertzelmann's portrait by
Constant and heard the price it cost; we also
went down to the jetty, and as many as could
got into the steam launch and went for a
spin on the lake. Blanche was among the
number, but I preferred to remain on the
lawn where the Marquise was playing croquet.
Her maid had evidently found the Geraudels,
for her voice was more tabloid than ever.
Some people who looked as if they lived
in pensions, and were no doubt Americans,
who had come to pay their respects
to their Minister and his handsome wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
strolled about the grounds aimlessly and
looked uncomfortable. One of them carried
on a polite conversation with a lackey who
spoke English, and whom he addressed as
"Sir." But the Wertzelmanns devoted
their whole attention to their personal friends,
and left the representatives of their nation to
amuse themselves in their own way.</p>

<p>Mr. Vanduzen brought the Duchesse de
Vaudricourt and Comte Belladonna in the
cab with him, and I overheard him squabbling
with the cabman over the fare, for,
from what passed between them, I judged
that the Duchesse had been a second
thought with Mr. Vanduzen, who had only
arranged with the cabman for himself and
the Comte. The cabman evidently won,
and Mr. Vanduzen arrived on the lawn so
perturbed that he forgot to kiss Mrs.
Wertzelmann's hand, a custom he has affected
since taking up his residence abroad.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An Austrian Nobleman</i></div>

<p>Behind Mr. Vanduzen's cab there drove
up a very smart landau belonging to Mrs.
Solomon G. Isaacs of St. Louis, who is stopping
at the National with her mother and
daughter. The Austrian nobleman, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
name heads the Schweitzerhof visitors' list,
for which they give him his room and food
when the latter article is not supplied to him
by Mrs. Isaacs, with whose daughter he is
<i>&eacute;pris</i>, came with them. He is even <i>plus distingu&eacute;</i>
than Comte Belladonna, for it is whispered
he was a friend of Crown Prince
Rudolph's, and knows so much about his
death that the Emperor has requested him
to live out of Austria. Mrs. Isaacs, who is
a widow, well <i>conserv&eacute;e</i>, would, I think,
sooner than let him slip out of the family,
take him herself, but he prefers the daughter,
who is an extremely beautiful and innocent
girl of seventeen. The disposal of the dollars,
of which they appear to possess millions,
rests with Mrs. Isaacs's mother, an impossible
old woman, who looks as if she had acquired
the etiquette of the salon after a very thorough
knowledge of that of the kitchen.
Her thirst for information is apparently unquenchable,
and I heard her ask Count
Albert if he was related to a <i>hofdame</i> at
Vienna, whose name I forget. He replied
that his maternal grandmother was a Hohenzollern
and his great-uncle had married a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Hapsburg, which information so delighted
Mrs. Johnson that she smacked her lips as
if she were tasting some of the sauces she
used to make in the good old days. I believe,
old as she is, that she would marry
Count Albert herself if he asked her; and I
am sure that <i>he</i> would not hesitate to do so,
if he were certain the fortune was entirely
hers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Madame Colorado</i></div>

<p>Mrs. Wertzelmann has a very pretty
French woman stopping at Schloss Gessler,
a Madame Colorado; she is really lovely,
and has the dearest little girl in the world.
Madame Colorado knows all the people you
have met at Croixmare. On the way back
to the National the Vicomte told me she was
angelic, as I can well believe; she was married
to a brute of a Chilian, who happily
killed himself and left her free; she at one
time thought of taking the veil, and the Vicomte
says her charities in Paris are enormous
and that the breath of scandal has
never touched her name. I feel quite drawn
to her, and shall try to know her better.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Schweitzerhof</i></div>

<p>To-night after dinner several of us went
down to the Schweitzerhof to see the fireworks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and hear the music. As everybody
was in the salon waiting to see Don Carlos
and his Duchesse pass through on their way
to dinner, we got splendid seats on the balcony.
The night was superb.&mdash;Your dearest Mamma.</p>

<span class="mr3">28th August</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>New People</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">The</span> season is in full swing, and yesterday
a number of new people "descended,"
as the French say, at the National.
First in importance were the Prince and
Princesse di Spezzia from Florence; the
Mar&eacute;chale de Vichy-Pontoise; Mademoiselle
Liane de Pougy of the Folies Berg&egrave;re;
and Professor Chzweiczy, who has discovered
the bacillus of paralysis, and whose great
scientific work "The Blot on the Brain"
has been translated into all the European
languages. This morning there was an
enormous crowd on the <i>quai</i> in front of the
hotel; Blanche said she was sure a crowned
head had arrived, but I thought it was more
likely that someone had had a fit, for we
could see a circle had been formed round
something or someone, people were tiptoeing
and crushing one another, and I expected a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
<i>sergent de ville</i> to cry every moment, "Air!
air!" as they did in Regent Street that
morning when we were coming out of Fuller's
and found the Duchesse of Rougemont's
footman foaming on the pavement. But
Blanche insisted it was an emperor, and she
was backed up by Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, who said it was
just like the crowds she had seen in Paris
when the Czar came. We found everybody
we knew sitting in the hall of the hotel and
in very bad humour, because it was awfully
hot and stuffy, and the waiters had brought
all the chairs inside lest they should be
broken by the crowd. I asked the Marquise
what had happened, and she said, with a
shrug, it was only Liane de Pougy taking
the air under the chestnuts. Professor
Chzweiczy sat in the same spot all the afternoon
reading "The Blot on the Brain," and
the letters on the cover were so big that the
Vicomte said you could distinguish them
across the <i>quai</i>, but nobody paid any attention
to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Signor Stefano Crestfallen</i></div>

<p>The Princesse di Spezzia held quite a
court in the hall, and stared at everybody
through her lorgnettes; they say she is at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
head of Florentine society and a young
Italian, who has a <i>magasin</i> on the <i>quai</i>
Schweitzerhof, and comes to the dances at
the National because men are scarce, has
begged Mr. Vanduzen to present him. But
Mr. Vanduzen refused, and Signor Stefano
went off crestfallen, finding it, I daresay,
quite impossible to reconcile the selling of
precious stones behind a counter with his
social ambitions.</p>

<p>Blanche spent the morning yesterday
automobiling with the Vicomte and the
Marquise, while I remained in the verandah
to rest, as we were to drive after lunch with
Sir Charles to a Schloss twenty miles away
to a garden party. Mrs. Johnson kept me
company, and told me that Count Albert had
gone to the Rigi for the day with Mrs.
Isaacs and Rosalie. She said they had been
presented at Berlin and Brussels, and had
intended to enjoy the same experience at
Dresden last winter, as they had letters to
the Minister there, but he made some paltry
objection and she had not pressed the matter,
though she added that she had written to the
Senator, to whom the Minister owed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
place, and that he would make it hot for
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Shopping and Sightseeing</i></div>

<p>I asked her if they had been to London,
and she said only for a week, and had never
had such a dull time, as they knew nobody,
and her room at the Carlton was so cold it
gave her rheumatism. They did some shopping
and sight-seeing, and had gone from the
Bank to Shepherd's Bush in the Tu'penny
Tube, but she preferred the Elevated in New
York, because of the scenery. However,
Mrs. Johnson told me quite in confidence,
that if Count Albert didn't propose to Rosalie,
they thought of going to London next
year for the season, and she asked me if I
could recommend a Countess who would
run them, and she wanted to know if there
was any institution to which she could write
and engage one, for she had heard in St.
Louis that poor Countesses did quite a business
that way. I told her we were not so
progressive in England as in the States, and
that I did not think there was as yet any
association of distressed gentlewomen where
one could hire a Countess for the London
season, but that perhaps if she wrote to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
editor of one of the Society papers, I daresay
he could provide a suitable person who
would get her access to the best houses.
Mrs. Johnson at once pulled a note-book
out of her pocket, and jotted down the
names of two or three papers I gave her,
then she looked at me rather shrewdly, and
asked what I thought would be the fee. I
said I didn't think she could do the London
season the way she would want to much
under ten thousand pounds all told.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "Count Albert won't
cost us as much as that, and if we secure
him we shan't go to London. From what
I can find out Continental society is less expensive
than English and just as good."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Automobile Accident</i></div>

<p>Blanche returned just before lunch in a
great state of excitement: it seems that in
going up the hill to the De Pivarts, something
went wrong with the automobile, and
it began to descend backwards at a frightful
pace; the Marquise screamed so loud that a
number of people, not knowing what was the
matter, rushed into the middle of the road,
and the automobile knocked down one who
happened to be the croupier at the Kursaal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and he was so badly hurt he had to be taken
to the hospital. Just as they expected to
batter down a wall at the foot of the hill,
and perish horribly, the automobile suddenly
stopped; they jumped out instantly,
and it was just in time, for it at once blew
up with such a noise, that the porter at the
Pension Thorvaldsen took it for the one
o'clock gun and began sounding the dinner-gong.</p>

<p>Blanche says that the Vicomte took it
quite coolly; he declared he always knew
the automobile would end like that, and he
should compel the company in Paris to give
him another, as they had guaranteed it to
run without accident for a year. The Marquise
fainted, and when Blanche left her she
was in hysterics in the Pension Thorvaldsen;
it all happened so quickly, that Blanche
said it was all over before she could realise
the danger. She was not even shaken.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mar&eacute;chale de Vichy-Pontoise</i></div>

<p>At lunch the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> made a mistake
and put some Germans at the table
occupied by the Mar&eacute;chale de Vichy-Pontoise,
and when she hobbled in, leaning on
her cane, and followed by Bijou, her pug,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
there was no place for her to sit. She was
in a towering rage, and shook her stick at
the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, and Bijou looked as if
he contemplated making his lunch off the
waiter's leg. A seat was eventually found
for her at our table, and another for Bijou,
who finished his chop in the Mar&eacute;chale's
lap. She glared at us several times as if
she thought it was an impertinence for us
to sit at the same table with her, and she
frightened the waiters out of their wits and
found fault with everything. I am sure she
is horribly old, for Sir Charles says she was
no chicken in the last year of the Empire,
when her salon was the most <i>suivi</i> in Paris.
Her <i>coiffure</i> is jet black, and her eyebrows
are bald and pencilled in arches. She is
awfully badly made up, but, as Blanche says,
it would take tons of rouge to hide the gutters
on her face which is lined like a railway-map.
All her clothes are made in the fashion
of 1870; she is covered at all times with
jewels and wears a daguerreotype brooch of
the late Mar&eacute;chal.</p>

<p>But, of course, she is <i>tr&egrave;s grande dame</i>,
and everyone tries to mollify her, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
wait on her and Bijou hand and foot, and
the Duchesse de Vaudricourt, who hates her
because the Mar&eacute;chale asked her before the
Vicomte and Mr. Vanduzen if she remembered
a certain ball at the Tuileries in '68,
calls her "Ma ch&egrave;re mar&eacute;chale."</p>

<h2>LETTER XIII</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Hotel National, Lucerne</span><br />
<span class="mr3">30th August</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Sonnenburgs</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;never</span> told you of the garden party
at Schloss Sonnenburg the other day,
and as it will give quite another aspect of
Lucerne life from that of the National and
Schloss Gessler, I will try to remember what
happened. It is rather difficult, for so much
transpires in the course of the day that I
am apt to forget what I did the day before.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Disagreeable Drive</i></div>

<p>In the first place Baroness Sonnenburg
is an Englishwoman, and Sir Charles knows
her quite well. So he offered to drive us
out to the Schloss and introduce us, telling
us it would be quite <i>comme il faut</i>, and that
the Sonnenburgs would be only too delighted
to meet us. The Vicomte occupied the
vacant seat in the landau, and we started
immediately after lunch, for we had over
twenty miles to drive. To know what dust
is you must come to Switzerland in August;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the road was like driving through sand, we
were powdered with it, a nasty, white, itchy
powder, and the flies, having devoured the
horses which flew along maddened with pain,
came to add their sting and buzzing to our
own sufferings from the dust. I nearly
shrieked with the discomfort of it all, and
longed for my balcony at the National.
The Vicomte began to talk of love to me,
but knowing the danger of such a subject
I peevishly begged him to desist, and a huge
bottle-green fly, with a most irritating buzz,
having drawn blood from his cheek, the
Vicomte became as peevish as I. It seemed
as if the journey would never end, which
made the thought of the return to Lucerne
<i>&eacute;pouvantable</i>, and we were none of us in a
good mood when a great yellow and black
building, whose walls were like a draught-board,
suddenly loomed out of a forest of
pine trees on the brow of a steep cliff.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Warm Welcome</i></div>

<p>When we drove up to the front door two
footmen in livery helped us out of the
carriage, and I could have cried from the
nervousness that the drive had fretted me
into. However, we found a maid with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
brushes and water and perfumes, and when
we were at all presentable again, another
carriage drove up with Mrs. Johnson, Mrs.
Isaacs and Rosalie, and their Austrian
Count. They were in as bad a temper as
we were from the dust and the flies, and I
heard Mrs. Johnson say that if "Mrs. Sonnenburg
hadn't been a baroness" she would
never have come. We passed down a long
hall whose walls were covered with family
portraits, more than enough to make up the
twenty-four quarterings of the Sonnenburg
arms. At the end of the hall was a room
into which we were shown by a footman.
A grand-looking man, who was introduced
by Sir Charles as Baron Sonnenburg, gave
us the warmest welcome in English, and led
us across the room where we were presented
to his wife and mother. Baroness Sonnenburg
spoke English with an accent which
was not affected, for she told us she had
not been in England for over twenty years.
She was one of the Trevorleys of Devonshire,
and the present baronet is her first
cousin. I doubt if she ever heard the name
of Paquin, and I suppose her clothes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
made by a seamstress in Lucerne, yet there
was no disguising the gentility of her appearance
and the breeding of her manners.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Pretty Custom</i></div>

<p>Blanche and I, who, from constant observation
of the people we mix with, are rapidly
becoming Continental, curtseyed to
the Dowager Baroness and kissed the hand
she held out. I think it is such a pretty
custom, and one we could adopt to advantage
in England, where every trace of the
manners of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> has disappeared.
Such a number of people were in the room
that we did not get the chance I should
have liked to converse with our hosts, and
we sauntered into an enormous octagonal
apartment, which we were told jutted sheer
over the precipice on which the Schloss is
built. The view from the windows was
very fine and extensive, and it made one
quite giddy to look down into the valley
which is nine hundred feet below.</p>

<p>There was a visitors' book here which Sir
Charles was signing for us when suddenly
there were shrieks of surprise and everybody
rushed to the windows. Through a cleft of
pine woods standing out against the bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
blue sky was a glittering, dazzling mass. It
was the Jungfrau, Baron Sonnenburg said,
and was only seen on rare occasions, and
nothing could be more fortunate than that
it should unveil its peerless loveliness to-day
of all days for the benefit of his guests.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An Al Fresco Repast</i></div>

<p>An <i>al fresco</i> repast was served on the old
battlements which have been turned out into
a <i>terrasse</i>. An awkward, blushing youth
was brought up to me by Baron Sonnenburg
and presented as his son, and I was told he
was going to England in the autumn to learn
English, of which he doesn't know a word.
Two rather pretty, but shockingly badly-dressed
girls, were talking to two Swiss
officers, but the attitudes of all were so stilted
and forced that I am sure they were not
enjoying the unusual liberty permitted on
this occasion.</p>

<p>The Duchesse de Vaudricourt whispered
to me that they were Baroness Sonnenburg's
daughters and were considered very English.
I was on the point of asking her what she
thought <i>I</i> was, but thought better of it, and
merely said, that from the extreme diffidence
they displayed, I should have taken them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
for French girls whose <i>dot</i> had not yet been
settled.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Wertzelmanns</i></div>

<p>The Wertzelmanns came late; they
brought Madame Colorado, who looked
perfectly angelic in a marvellous white cr&ecirc;pe
de chine, and a hat that killed you at a
glance. They brought the news of the accident
to the Vicomte de Narjac's automobile,
and Mrs. Wertzelmann excitedly told a
circle, who had gathered to admire her
clothes and her jewels, that it was the sensation
of the season, she had never heard of
anything so dreadful. And Baron Sonnenburg,
who had never seen either Blanche or
the Vicomte before, and had forgotten their
names already, was told how the Vicomte's
automobile had run away and exploded, terribly
mangling the croupier at the Kursaal,
blowing the Vicomte and Miss Blaine, such
a sweet English girl, to smithereens, and that
the poor Marquise de Pivart had gone mad
from the shock.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An Amusing Story</i></div>

<p>Mrs. Wertzelmann dwelt on the horrible
details with a tenacity there was no shaking,
and at every exclamation of pity uttered by
her audience she but made the story more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
graphic. The Vicomte and Blanche, who
all the while had listened quietly, unobserved
by Mrs. Wertzelmann, stuffed their mouths
with handkerchiefs to keep from shrieking.
But when the Vicomte heard that a boatman
had found one of his arms clinging to
a fragment of automobile in the lake, and
that they were picking his brains off the
walls of the Pension Thorvaldsen, he could
contain himself no longer.</p>

<p>You should have seen Mrs. Wertzelmann's
face when she saw Blanche and the Vicomte
bursting with laughter, and she looked about
the <i>terrasse</i> as if she expected to see the Marquise
and the croupier eating ices in Baron
Sonnenburg's beach chairs; and later when
we left I am sure she wondered why we drove
off in the landau with the fly-bitten horses
instead of in the automobile.</p>

<p>"If Maria once begins to tell a story,"
said Mr. Wertzelmann to me, "there is no
stopping her. I knew she would end by
putting her foot into it."</p>

<p>As Mrs. Wertzelmann's confusion was so
great, and she volunteered no explanation,
I fancy the Sonnenburgs, who do not go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
into Lucerne frequently, are wondering why
the <i>Swiss and Nice Times</i> have given no
account of the terrible automobile disaster.</p>

<p>Don't ask me how we got back to Lucerne,
but four more pitiable-looking objects you
never would wish to see. We were utterly
exhausted, and I never made any appearance
the next day till lunch.</p>

<p>I am glad you are having such a good
time at Croixmare. Give my kind regards
to your Godmamma and my best love to
H&eacute;loise. I am glad you have been such a
success; I pride myself that whether in
England or in France <i>l'ing&eacute;nue va bien</i>.&mdash;Your

<h2>LETTER XIV</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Hotel National, Lucerne</span><br />
<span class="mr3">1st September</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Ball of the Season</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">The</span> invitations are out to a <i>cotillon</i> at
Schloss Gessler on the 7th. It is
to be a grand affair, the favours are to come
from the Maison Bail at Paris, the supper
and the music from the National, and the
money to pay for it all out of Mr. Wertzelmann's
bank account, which it goes without
saying is a big one.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Count Albert's Proposal</i></div>

<p>Everybody seems to have been invited,
and Mr. Wertzelmann told me he intended
that it should be remembered as the ball of
the season. Old Mrs. Johnson came and
sat next to me on the <i>quai</i> this morning,
and broke the news that Count Albert has
proposed to Rosalie and been accepted. She
didn't seem to like it when I said I felt sorry
for the girl, because she was too good for
Count Albert, who was old enough to be her
father, and I advised her to look him up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and all his antecedents at Vienna before the
marriage ceremony. But she was quite
satisfied that he was a real, live Count, because
the "Schweitzerhof knew all about
him." I shouldn't be surprised, however,
that she takes my advice, for she is a shrewd
old woman, but just fancy anyone taking a
husband on a hotel guarantee!</p>

<p>A very pretty woman&mdash;a blonde, with a
figure that the Venus de Milo might envy,
and dressed, oh! l&agrave; l&agrave;! shades of Paquin
and Worth!&mdash;passed us several times,
walking up and down the <i>quai</i>. Everybody
turned round to stare at her, and everybody
asked who she was, and the Princesse di
Spezzia, who was talking to Comte Belladonna,
put up her lorgnettes. The Duchesse
de Vaudricourt leaned over the arm of her
chair and whispered to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Voil&agrave; la plus belle courtisane de Florence.
C'est une des bijoux de M. le Prince di
Spezzia. La fameuse Vittoria Lodi!"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Monsieur le Prince</i></div>

<p>Later on the Prince di Spezzia sauntered
out of the National on the arm of the Marquis
de Pivart, both dressed faultlessly as
usual, <i>&agrave; l'Anglais</i>, and they actually stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and spoke to the <i>demi-mondaine</i>. The
Duchesse de Vaudricourt became quite excited
over it, and gave me a regular <i>New-York-Herald-Paris-Edition</i>
of Monsieur le
Prince. He is very English in appearance,
but then Poole makes all his clothes, and
he could easily pass for an Englishman,
which I think would please him immensely.
But why&mdash;why will these smart foreigners
who affect English fashions always wear
lavender or buff-coloured French kid gloves?
Perhaps you will say, for the same reason
that Englishwomen who are for ever talking
of Paris fashions wear English corsets.
So under all the artificiality of civilisation
national traits come out in a pair of gloves
or a pair of stays!</p>

<p>The Prince looks as if he would improve
on acquaintance, but I think it distinctly rude
and bad form of him to stop and talk to such
a woman as la belle Lodi within a stone's
throw of his wife. The Duchesse says he
has been a <i>mauvais sujet</i> since sixteen, when
he disguised himself as a priest and confessed
dozens of people, and if it hadn't been
that his uncle was a Cardinal, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
have got into some very hot water. He
drives with the Lodi daily in the Cascine
at Florence, and makes her follow him
wherever he goes. She has an apartment
at the Schweitzerhof. The Princesse
doesn't seem to mind; I don't suppose it
would make any difference if she did. She
is always beautifully dressed, and spends
most of her time staring at people through
her lorgnettes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Professor Chzweiczy</i></div>

<p>Poor Professor Chzweiczy (you can pronounce
this name to suit yourself, for nobody
knows what it should be, and Blanche
calls it Squeezey) sits every day on the <i>quai</i>;
he holds the "Blot on the Brain" close in
front of his face as if he were near-sighted.
I think he must have a cast in his eyes, for
they always seem to be looking over the top
of the book at the people passing. I am
sure that if it were known that he is one of
the greatest medical scientists of the day, he
would be besieged like Liane de Pougy;
but nobody ever even glances at him; they
have got his name spelled wrong in the
hotel visitors' list, and wedged in out of
sight between some people whose names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
have a globe-trotting sound and who look
like a party of Cook's "Specials."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Liane de Pougy</i></div>

<p>Liane de Pougy sits now in the garden of
the National, for the crowds nearly suffocated
her on the <i>quai</i>. She is very beautiful
and dresses very quietly; you would never
dream that she is as well known in Paris as
a monument or a boulevard. A young
Frenchman has for the last two days been
doing his best to attract her attention by
sitting near her, and pretending to read her
"L'Insaisissable." I believe that since her
arrival there are nearly as many copies of
this <i>roman v&eacute;cu</i>, as she calls it, as Baedekers
at the National. It is hard to say which is
the most interesting&mdash;herself or her book.
I caught her looking at the old Mar&eacute;chale
de Vichy-Pontoise yesterday with the most
untranslatable expression. I am not quite
sure but that in spite of her triumphs she
would change places with the Mar&eacute;chale if
she could, and wear the old harridan's moustache
and the daguerreotype brooch of the
late Mar&eacute;chal and feed Bijou and all. As
it is, not a woman at the National would
dream of speaking to her, and the Mar&eacute;chale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
would as soon think of strangling Bijou as
of sitting down at the same table as the
famous Liane.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Comedy</i></div>

<p>Blanche has just come in to say that a
Count Fosca has arrived at the National,
having automobiled all the way from Paris,
and that the Vicomte is completely <i>boulevers&eacute;</i>.
She is laughing so over something
that Th&eacute;r&egrave;se is telling her that I cannot
write any more.</p>

<p>I can only catch the words, "Mrs. Johnson,"
"Prince di Spezzia," "Ascenseur,"
"no lights." I leave it to you to make a
comedy out of the missing links.&mdash;Your
dearest Mamma.</p>

<h2>LETTER XV</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Hotel National, Lucerne</span><br />
<span class="mr3">3rd September</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Mishap</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">It</span> rained yesterday for the first time
since we have been in Lucerne. As I
was looking at the lake which the wind had
turned into an ocean with waves mountains
high, I saw Comte Belladonna soaked to
the skin hurrying along the <i>quai</i> to the
hotel. Poor little old beau! He had got
himself up as usual in spotless flannels,
patent-leather boots, straw hat, and lavender
kids, and was coming from the direction of
the pension where his inamorata lives&mdash;the
pretty, portionless American girl&mdash;when
the rain had overtaken him. His legs, unaccustomed
to the unusual exercise of running,
seemed inclined one moment to run
into the flower-beds on the <i>quai</i> and another
to contemplate a plunge into the lake.
Sheets of water fell from the brim of his
straw hat, his gloves and his boots were irretrievably
spoilt, and his flannels had that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
heavy, soppy look that bathing-suits have.
He was as full of water as a sponge, and
I am sure he would have been the better for
a squeeze.</p>

<p>I called Blanche to look at him, and we
both agreed that he would catch a chill after
such a wetting that would carry him off.
But when we went down to lunch we found
him dry and chirpy, and paying his <i>devoirs</i>
to the Princesse di Spezzia, as if he had
made his toilet for the first time that day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Funny Thing</i></div>

<p>A funny thing happened in the afternoon
in connection with the old beau's wetting
that would have covered anybody else but
such a consummate old courtier with ridicule.
After lunch it cleared off, and the sun came
out very hot and dried up things so quickly
that everybody had tea as usual in the garden
of the hotel. The Hungarian band had
just finished playing a valse of Waldeuffel,
and the Mar&eacute;chale de Vichy-Pontoise had
hobbled out into the garden and settled
herself comfortably in her favourite seat
next to the Princesse di Spezzia when something
slowly descended from the sky performing
curious evolutions. Everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
speculated as to what it could be and where
it came from, when it calmly lighted on the
head of the Mar&eacute;chale, who gave a wizened
shriek, and having disengaged herself from
it shied it away savagely with the end of her
stick. Bijou at once seized it in his mouth,
and having gambolled about the grass with
it proceeded to improvise it into a broom
and sweep up the gravel path with it. The
difficulty of getting him to relinquish his
possession of it caused a great deal of merriment,
and the young man who reads "L'Insaisissable"
and ogles Liane de Pougy at
the same time suddenly put his foot on it
with such force that Bijou, who was scampering
off as hard as he could go with an end
in his mouth, was brought up short, and,
having turned a rather violent somersault
in the air, let go and went off whimpering
to the Mar&eacute;chale, who looked as if she
could have eaten the young Frenchman.
He picked up Bijou's mysterious plaything
and held it up, so that everybody could see&mdash;a
white flannel jacket, or what was left of it,
of the jauntiest cut in the world. No one
claiming it, he handed it to a waiter who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
discovered on a tag the <i>chiffre</i> of Comte
Belladonna! Instead of at once withdrawing
with the garment he informed the Comte
that it belonged to him. The Comte, who
knew it all the time and had not cared to
make himself the butt of the National, examined
it, shook his head, examined it again,
and bursting into a laugh exclaimed to the
Princesse di Spezzia with the utmost self-possession:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear Princesse, alas! this rag is indeed
mine. This morning, spotless and
sweet-smelling, I arrayed my old bones in
it, and its mate, whose legs you may see
dangling out of that window up there under
the roof; but, as if envious of the figure I
cut in it, the elements having determined
to deprive me of it, flooded me out of it.
Not being an American millionaire, I hung
it out of my window to dry, and the wind
did the rest. Heaven grant that the trousers
do not come to look after the jacket. Pity
me, Princesse, I had worn it but once; it
was cut at 'Old England.' Here, gar&ccedil;on,
it is yours now."</p>

<p>It was not the words, which were funny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
enough, but the manner in which they were
uttered, that made every one laugh <i>with</i> the
Comte instead of <i>at</i> him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Signor Stefano</i></div>

<p>The Princesse is a dear; she proved to-night
that she is really a <i>grande dame</i>, and
that it is neither her name nor her pose
which makes her one. Young Signor Stefano,
a shopkeeper, we would call him in
England, came again to the National to-night
to dance. The proprietor, who is
very anxious that these dances should be a
success, has given him, and two or three
other young fellows like him, the entr&eacute;e.
Of course, according to the Continental
custom, they can ask any one they like to
dance, but a natural and creditable diffidence
has kept them from forcing themselves upon
any of the smart set, and they are generally
to be seen reversing and chass&eacute;eing with the
people from the pensions, who sit at one end
of the ball-room and stare at the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Stefano Recognised</i></div>

<p>Young Stefano is very good-looking, and
dances divinely, and has attracted the attention
of all of us women, and everybody
who has been in the <i>magasin</i>, where he is
in charge of the precious stone department,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
has remarked his quiet gentlemanly behaviour.
I think I wrote you that he asked
Mr. Vanduzen to present him to the Princesse
di Spezzia and was refused, and I must
say when he came into the room to-night
he looked so much a gentleman and so
handsome that I horrified Mr. Vanduzen
by telling him to bring Stefano to me.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Princesse di Spezzia</i></div>

<p>He was covered with confusion when he
was introduced, and when we danced he
bumped me into two or three people, for
he held me as if he were afraid of me, and
we took up as much room as four people.
I made him sit next me and talked to him,
and cleverly turned the conversation on to
the Princesse di Spezzia. He said very
modestly that desire had got the better of
him the other night, and he had presumed
to be presented to her and had been snubbed,
as he deserved. His <i>magasin</i> is transferred
to Florence for the winter; he is a
Florentine, and has often seen the Princesse
in the Cascine and admired her very much;
he told me that he had no desire to meet
her as an equal, that he knew he was only a
<i>petit bourgeois</i>, but that he would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
proud to be presented to such a great lady.
I surprised him by saying I would ask the
Princesse if she had any objection, and if not
it would be easy enough to gratify his small
desire. His thanks were profuse, and when
I got a chance I told the Princesse the story.
She was furious with Mr. Vanduzen and
has cut him dead since; she wondered how
he dared to refuse to present any one to
her without her permission, and she declared
it was one of the greatest pleasures
of her position to have the people of
Florence presented to her and admire her.
She chatted for some time with Stefano
and gave him permission to address her
at any time he chose without any fear
of being snubbed. I watched her closely
all the time; her manner was totally free
from patronage, but it let Stefano know
that she was what he had always thought,
the Princesse di Spezzia, the greatest lady
in Florence.</p>

<p>She has immensely flattered his pride by
her recognition and preserved her own dignity,
and Blanche and I have agreed that
in point of manners and etiquette she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
teach any of our great ladies in England
how to hold themselves.</p>

<p>We think she is a dear, and wish we knew
how to dress as she does and to stare
through lorgnettes and to endure horrid
bores such as the Mar&eacute;chale. I wish the
Prince appreciated her more; he plays the
devil devilishly well. Sir Charles says there
is no question of doubt but that the family
was a noble one in the days of the Roman
Empire. Adieu.&mdash;Your dearest Mamma.</p>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">Mrs. Isaacs</span> (who, by the way, is
not one of the children of Israel,
if her husband was) went yesterday to Berne.
The Vicomte says she carried the Almanac
de Gotha instead of Baedeker, and that the
porter at the hotel who bought her ticket
declared that her ultimate destination is
Vienna. So that I suppose they are looking
up Count Albert.</p>

<p>The Vicomte has been like a bear with
a sore head ever since Count Fosca automobiled
from Paris. He behaves so childishly,
as if no one in the world should have
an automobile but himself. He spends
several hours a day fencing with an Italian;
you know duelling is his other occupation
in Paris, and I expect he is going to take
it up seriously till he gets a new automobile.
He glares at Count Fosca and mutters "So"
under his breath like a German, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
expecting to hear daily that they are going
to fight, and all over an automobile!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ball at Schloss Gessler</i></div>

<p>But people are too much excited over
the ball at Schloss Gessler on the day after
to-morrow to pay much attention to the
Vicomte and his grievances. Mr. Wertzelmann
told me to-day that if people talked
so much about the ball before it came off
he wondered what they would say about
it after. He never did things by halves,
and this was a ball which should be remembered
for years to come. It is to cost
thousands of francs, and if the Russian
<i>boyar</i> (don't ask me his name, I know it
has an itch at the end of it) who is
Mrs. Wertzelmann's devoted admirer, and
practically runs Schloss Gessler, does his
duty properly, I have no doubt it will be,
as Mr. Wertzelmann says, something to
remember.</p>

<p>It will be the end of the season here,
and, as we have stayed longer than we
intended, we shall hurry home after it.
We really have managed to do other things
besides frivol. We have seen the Lion
and we have been to Flu&euml;len and drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to Schloss Sonnenburg, but there was little
of the country or scenery we saw on that
occasion, owing to the flies and the dust.
Yesterday we added to our knowledge of
the Lake of the Four Cantons by spending
the night on the top of the Stanzerhorn.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Stanzerhorn</i></div>

<p>Quite late in the afternoon Sir Charles
came over to the National to ask us if
we would come with him then and there
to see the sunset and sunrise in the Alps
from the Stanzerhorn. He assured us we
would find a good hotel and that it was
worth the trouble, and as we had nothing
better to do we went. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se filled two
handbags with necessaries and we caught
the last boat from Lucerne. There was
nobody we knew on the boat, and Blanche
said she felt game for anything, and game
we were before we saw our comfortable
rooms at the National again and our indispensable
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se and dear, dear Paquin.</p>

<p>As Sir Charles had described it as a
"rough and ready jaunt," and "a picnic in
the clouds," and turned up at the National
in snuff-coloured "knickers" that looked
as if Bijou had been introducing them to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
gravel-path, and carrying a brand-new alpenstock
with "Lucerne" and "G&uuml;tsch" and
"Sonnenburg" burnt into it, we decided to
wear our serge walking skirts and men's
shirts and straw-hats. Blanche looked very
well in hers, for it is a style that suits her,
but I nearly wept at my own reflection, and
I was delighted there was to be no one else
of the party but Sir Charles. Blanche said
my skirt was positively indecent; it came
just to the tops of my boots, and was really
made for bicycling and not for walking. I
felt like a Gordon Highlander, and Blanche
declared that if the skirt was a plaid I would
have looked like one. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se too went
into fits of laughter, and said she was sure
that Sir Charles would not recognise me. I
was half inclined to give up the excursion,
but Blanche said it was ridiculous, and that
I couldn't possibly take Paquin to the top
of the Stanzerhorn, and that I looked charming
from my waist up.</p>

<p>I tried to discover a blush somewhere in
my veins when we stood in the hall of the
hotel, but somehow I couldn't find one.
Fortunately for my vanity we got on to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
steamboat without being recognised, and I
made a mental vow that I would never employ
a Taunton seamstress again. The
Italian boy with the monkey and the post-cards
that we saw the first day we arrived,
and whom Blanche declared was a nobleman
in disguise, was on board. He went second-class,
and was talking to a Swiss peasant with
goitre just below us. The monkey travelled
first all the way to Alpnacht, for the steamboat
people didn't dare touch it; it ate
apples at Blanche's feet when it wasn't
frightening people out of their wits by
bounding about the deck. The disguised
nobleman, who can't be more than seventeen,
recognised us, and gave such a smile and
bow! Blanche put a franc into the tin cup
round the monkey's neck, and when we got
off at Stanz the boy brushed off the gangplank
before we stepped on it, with his cap,
though the plank was spotless. As Blanche
said, it gave her quite a Sir-Walter-Raleigh-Queen-Elizabeth-and-the-Cloak
feeling, and
we declared he was the most picturesque
tramp we had ever seen, but Sir Charles,
who hasn't a scrap of romance in him, said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
he looked as if he belonged to an Anarchist
Society.</p>

<p>Stanz is a funny little town, and people
only come to it to leave it. Some Germans
with ropes and pick-axes over their shoulders,
and who looked as if they meant business,
got off at Stanz, and as one makes the
ascent of Titlis from here, we concluded that
was their destination. Sir Charles made us
walk to the little <i>platz</i> to see the statue to
Arnold von Winkelreid, but we preferred
Tell's at Altdorf. The funicular to the top
of the Stanzerhorn makes one feel goose-pimply
all over; it is not only steep, but
when you get near the top you look out of
the car window over a sheer precipice of two
thousand feet. There are two cars attached
to an endless cable, and while one creeps up
the mountain like a horrid antediluvian bug
the other crawls down. If the cable should
break, one would catapult little Stanz to
atoms and the other would Jules Verne itself
to the top of the Stanzerhorn.</p>

<p>When we got to the two thousand feet
place a German woman fainted, and I felt as
if I were about to develop heart failure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
But Blanche and Sir Charles leaned out of
the windows and raved over the scenery,
while an American woman read Baedeker
out loud to another. As soon as we reached
the top, we went to the hotel and got rooms,
but discovered to our horror that we had
left our bags at Stanz and that we couldn't
get them that night. We both gave it to
Sir Charles, I can tell you, but he only
laughed and said the proprietor's wife would
fit us out all right. We at once went in
search of this individual, and you may
imagine our consternation when I tell you
that the proprietor was a bachelor, or a
widower&mdash;I believe he tried to explain
which it was, but we fairly shrieked with
horror&mdash;and moreover the only females
belonging to the hotel were some Swiss girls
with symptoms of goitre.</p>

<p>The proprietor was bland and apologetic,
and told Sir Charles that he would see we
were provided with the necessary articles
before we went to bed. With this we had
to be content, and went out upon a sort of
promenade where there was a telescope and
a man to explain the views. He seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
have learnt his "patter" by heart, for when
he was interrupted he had to begin all over.
Five minutes before sunset begins they ring
a gong and everybody climbs up a tiny
peak where you can see only snow mountains
and the lake like a cloud far below.
We waited for half an hour and saw nothing
else; the man of the telescope said it was
the only failure of the season. It got frightfully
cold all of a sudden, and we went back
to the hotel wishing we were at the National.</p>

<p>They gave us a remarkably good <i>table
d'h&ocirc;te</i> dinner, considering how remote we
were from everything. The people were
mostly Germans, and there was such a curious
German-American woman who sat next
me. If she had been decently dressed she
would have been quite pretty; she was very
confidential, as strange Americans are inclined
to be, and gave us her history from
the time she was five. She fairly astounded
me by saying she was known as Patsy Bolivar,
the champion lady swimmer of the
world, and she showed me several photographs
of herself which she carries about
with her, and also one of the gold belt she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
won in New York. Quite contrary to the
usual run of celebrities, she was modest, and
did not appear at all offended that I had
never heard of her before.</p>

<p>After dinner we all went to watch the
flash-light at work, and saw it turned on to
the Stanz and Lucerne, in red, white, and
blue. As the sunrise was to be very early
we went to bed at nine in time to be ready
for it. Blanche and I had connecting rooms,
and we found on the pillows of our beds two
spotless and neatly folded <i>robes de nuit</i>, and
a hair-brush and a comb on the dressing-table,
and we blessed monsieur le propri&eacute;taire.
But imagine our horror, when we
were ready to put on our host's garments,
to find that they were in reality his own!
They reached just above our knees, and had
"Ricardo" embroidered in red cotton on
the buttons. There was nothing to do but
to make the best of it, and as it was terribly
cold we hastily got into bed in our proprietor's
night-shirts, and slept soundly till we
heard a hideous gong and knew that it
was four o'clock and sunrise. We dressed
quickly, and clambered on to the little peak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
again, where we found everybody shivering
and jumping about to keep warm, and while
we waited the sun rose. I won't attempt to
describe it, for I am neither Walter Scott
nor Baedeker, and if you want to know
what it is like you must come to Switzerland
yourself and spend the night on a
mountain.</p>

<p>We had delicious coffee and rolls before
leaving: Sir Charles paid the bill for us.
Would you believe it, they actually took off
a franc each for the failure of the sunset
the previous day. I thought it exceedingly
honourable, and different from the grasping
way they have at hotels in England where
they have only one way of making coffee
and omelette, and that is <i>&agrave; l'Anglaise</i>. We
didn't dare thank the proprietor for the
things he had lent us, and he said, with
such a nice smile to me, as we left:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Madame est-elle bien dormie? Les
r&ecirc;ves &eacute;taient-ils doux? J'esp&egrave;re &ccedil;a."</p>

<p>Horrid man!</p>

<p>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se was waiting for us when we got
back, and had our baths and Paquin ready.&mdash;Your
dearest Mamma.</p>

<h2>LETTER XVII</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Hotel National, Lucerne</span><br />
<span class="mr3">7th September</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Wertzelmann Ball</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">This</span> is our last day here, and we leave
by the express for Paris to-night.
Mr. Wertzelmann said he was going to give
a ball that would be remembered, and he
has kept his promise. I hardly know where
to begin to tell you all about it. I had one
offer of marriage and one of elopement, and
got home at six in the morning.</p>

<p>First of all, Blanche and I, looking every
bit as well dressed as any of the smart
women here, drove out to Schloss Gessler
by ourselves. Comte Belladonna and Mr.
Vanduzen hinted outrageously for the two
vacant seats, but we didn't intend to have
our frocks crushed to save them a few
francs, and wouldn't take their hints.</p>

<p>The Comte eventually got Mrs. Isaacs'
seat in Mrs. Johnson's landau, but Mr.
Vanduzen had to hire, and just as he was
about to drive off the Duchesse de Vaudricourt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
rushed up and begged him for a seat,
as she couldn't get a cab in the town.
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se told me this morning that the
Duchesse has no maid, and that her room
is above the <i>escalier de service</i> next to the
Comte's, so I fancy they keep <i>her</i> at the
National too as an advertisement for the
sake of her name, though it's only Louis
Philippe.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Schloss Gessler the
scene was undeniably lovely; the grounds
were like fairy-land, and Mr. Wertzelmann
had had the electric light brought out
from Lucerne, and had tried to turn a part
of the lake into a Venetian canal. Mrs.
Wertzelmann, in the most lovely costume I
ever saw, received in the great hall. She
never looked handsomer; her dress was
made entirely of point lace over white silk,
and made as only Worth or Paquin ever
make for American millionaires. Round
her neck was a serpent of diamonds holding
in its open jaws an immense emerald. Both
she and Mr. Wertzelmann received their
guests with the most perfect sincerity and
hospitality. There was not a scrap of affectation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
about them; it must be nice to be so
rich that you can afford to be natural. Mr.
Wertzelmann wore on the lapel of his
dress-coat something like a button, with the
American flag on it as a badge; all the
foreigners wore decorations; don't ask me
what they were,&mdash;if they were not Garters or
Black Eagles, they looked as well. Even Sir
Charles wore an Ashantee medal; he went in
his uniform especially at Mr. Wertzelmann's
request, who said he wanted a bit of colour
in the room, only Sir Charles's tunic is not
scarlet, and he looked somewhat like a
commissionaire.</p>

<p>Madame Colorado was angelic as usual&mdash;what
a lovely nun she would make! She
was helping the Wertzelmanns to receive,
and she looked after the Americans from the
<i>pensions</i> that the Minister felt obliged to invite.
It was great fun watching the guests
arrive, and as we got there early we saw
everybody; the Hungarian band from the
National came out in a char-&agrave;-banc, but the
supper was sent out in the afternoon. The
ball-room was draped with the American and
Swiss flags, and the national anthems of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
two countries were played before the dancing
began. There was no "state set" as we
have in England, and nobody paid any attention
to precedence. Mrs. Wertzelmann
opened the ball with young Stefano. There
was something higgledy-piggledy yet very
splendid about the whole function; it went
with far more spirit than such things go with
us; people had come to enjoy themselves, and
not to be martyrised by stupid formalities
and etiquette. The musicians played ravishingly;
they seemed to be intoxicated with
their music, and sometimes they couldn't
contain themselves but sang to the waltzes.
There was an <i>&eacute;lan</i> in the air. Mrs. Wertzelmann's
portrait by Constant had electric
lights all round the frame, and there was a
champagne fountain in the refreshment room.
The gaiety was almost barbaric in its extravagance,
and was contagious. The men said
the most outrageous things. The Marquis
de Pivart, who had not paid much attention
to me since I chaffed him about H&eacute;loise that
night at the Schweitzerhof, danced with me
three times running; he dances well, but
held me so tight I could hardly breathe, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
his breath was so hot on my neck it burnt.
He asked me if I would like to go down to
the lake to see the illumination; the night
was splendid and very warm, there was no
dew, and you could see the snow on Titlis
as the moonbeams fell on it.</p>

<p>Without any preamble the Marquis burst
into the most passionate declarations. He
told me he had loved me in secret since the
first time he had met me; would I flee with
him then and there, catch the night train for
Berne and Paris, live like Alfred de Musset
and George Sand, and a lot more idiotic bosh;
and he put his arms round me, and before I
could release myself he bit me on the neck.
I was so frightened that for the first time in
my life, Elizabeth, I lost my presence of
mind&mdash;I screamed. I don't know whether
any one heard or saw, and I don't care. I
told him he was a brute and I hated him,
and I rushed as hard as I could under a
huge Bengal light where I could easily be
seen. I trembled so I could scarcely stand,
and some of the wax from the candle dripped
upon me. He came up with excuses and
more protestations of love, but I said if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
didn't leave me at once I should scream for
help, and I must have looked as if I meant
it, for he muttered something in his horrid
black beard and went away. Then I went
back to the ball-room and found Blanche.
I told her what had happened, and asked
her if she could see the marks of his teeth.
She said the place only looked a tiny bit
red, and we went to the dressing-room,
where I powdered it.</p>

<p>After that I told Blanche that I shouldn't
feel safe except with the dowagers. They sat
in a room by themselves and had waiters
bringing them champagne and ices, and they
talked the most outrageous scandal. I sat
down beside Mrs. Johnson; she said I
looked pale and recommended some champagne
frapp&eacute;, and called a waiter and ordered
a glass for me and one for herself. She
was very talkative and fairly peppered her
conversation with French words, though she
wouldn't understand you if you said, "Comment
vous portez-vous?"</p>

<p>She told me that the Wertzelmanns were
<i>parvenus</i>&mdash;mushrooms, she called them&mdash;and
Mr. W. had made his money out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
oil, and that they had never been into Society
till they came abroad. She was very
communicative also on the subject of Rosalie's
marriage, which she said was to take
place in Paris in the autumn and would be a
very grand affair. As for Count Albert she
hadn't enough praise for him, and he was
so devoted and attentive in coming often to
see if she wanted anything that I am sure he
knows where the dollars are to come from.
I tried to find out what had taken Mrs.
Isaacs away so suddenly, but Mrs. Johnson
is cunning, she smelt a rat, and the only
reason I could extract was "business."</p>

<p>She made one amusing break. Mrs.
Wertzelmann came in to see if all was going
well with the chaperones, and exclaimed
when she saw me among them. Mrs. Johnson,
who evidently hates her, began to put
on "side," and talked about her hotel in the
Faubourg St. Germain, which she rented
from the Duc de Quatre Bras, and described
a ball she had given there to which all the
<i>demi monde</i> had come. Funny as this was,
it was made still funnier by the fact that
Mrs. Wertzelmann, who knows no more of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
French than Mrs. Johnson, didn't see the
joke.</p>

<p>I had by this time recovered sufficiently
to go back to the ball-room, where, as it was
on the stroke of midnight, the <i>cotillon</i> was
about to commence. Young Stefano came
up and asked me to dance it with him. The
Marquis had the grace not to put in an
appearance; I believe he was playing baccarat
in the card-room.</p>

<p>The favours were very pretty and appropriate,
as the Wertzelmanns did not choose
them, but simply gave the Maison Bail
<i>carte blanche</i>. The Duchesse de Vaudricourt
was disappointed; I believe she expected
to get diamonds. The Vicomte de
Narjac and the Russian with an unpronounceable
name and a <i>grande passion</i> for
Mrs. Wertzelmann, who, I hope, knows
how to contain himself better than the
Marquis, led the <i>cotillon</i>. They did it
awfully well, as if they had never done
anything else all their lives. They went
somewhere and changed their clothes, and
came back with Louis Quinze perukes,
crimson satin coats, with lace fichus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
black knee-breeches and stockings, and
diamond buckles in their pumps. They
really looked quite smart, while an Englishman
would have felt self-conscious and foolish,
and looked it.</p>

<p>At two o'clock the dancing ceased, and
supper was served at t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te tables on
the battlements, as Mr. Wertzelmann persists
in calling the <i>terrasse</i>. The supper
was delicious, and there was a waiter to each
chair; the Hungarian band came out and
played, and paper balloons, in the shape of
monsters with lights inside, were sent up
in the air from the lawn.</p>

<p>It was awfully jolly and gay, and poor
Stefano took too much champagne. It
made his eyes burn like coals; he began by
telling me in Italian that he should never
forget me for my kindness in presenting
him to the Princesse di Spezzia&mdash;they
left Lucerne yesterday, and so did the Lodi&mdash;and
ended by declaring he adored me.
He was so fearfully earnest, and his voice
was so subdued and tender, and he never
attempted any liberties that I almost wished
he would. I am sure he ought to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
been born the Marquis, and the Marquis
behind a counter. He wanted me to marry
him, and told me how many lira they paid
him at the shop a month, and that we could
keep a <i>m&eacute;nage</i> very well on his salary; we
were to have rooms in the Via Tornabuoni
over a Bon March&eacute; he knew of, and dine
once a week in the Cascine, and look at the
smart people. It was too absurd. But he
meant it, and when I told him No firmly,
two tears came into his eyes, and he had
such a Lion of Lucerne look that I almost
laughed. And he is only seventeen! Poor
Stefano! if they make love like him in Italy,
I wonder how the women ever refuse. But
your mamma, Elizabeth, knows her world
too well to do a <i>b&ecirc;tise</i>. Stefano and his
love-making was just the last finishing touch
to a delightful revel. When he gets the
champagne out of his eyes and the Hungarian
band out of his brain, he will forget me.
But I think it is a mistake to admit people
of such very inferior rank into our society,
even if they speak grammatically and read
Alfieri.</p>

<p>Comte Belladonna wilted at midnight; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
danced once with Rosalie, and would have
given anything afterwards to go back to the
National. He is made more for afternoon-tea
and dinner parties than for balls. He
hinted several times to Mrs. Johnson that
they should go, but she is as hard as nails,
and waited till the end. When he finally
did go, the sun was rising in the Alps; he
not only looked his eighty years, but had
dwindled till he looked like the boy in the
Struwelpter who faded away from starvation.
I expect he wished he had never
come, like the Mar&eacute;chale. Ah well, it has
been a jolly jaunt, and in spite of the dissipation
I feel the better for the change. We
shall both be in England together. I wonder
if you have enjoyed Croixmare as much
as Blanche and I have enjoyed Lucerne. I
am so glad we didn't go to Scarborough.
Au revoir.&mdash;Your dearest Mamma.</p>

<p>Bond Street is <i>triste</i> in the mornings, and
as for the Park, oh, l&agrave; l&agrave;!&mdash;the only people
one sees there are the hospital nurses and
the policemen. We don't get up till eleven,
and then go straight to Paquin, till one.
The first day we had lunch at Prince's, but
there were such funny-looking people there
that we have been to the Trocadero since.
I am sure those who were at Prince's were
there because they had heard it was fashionable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
The <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, who was chef to
the bishop of St. Esau, told me that there
hadn't been even a baronet across the threshold
for two months. I am sure the people
came from Leeds and Birmingham, and they
stared at one another as if they expected to
read Burke or Debrett written on their faces.
At the Trocadero the music is good, and
though you would never dream of calling
the people smart, yet they are interesting.
The women look like problem-plays, and I
am sure the men spend their time between
Sandown Park and St. John's Wood.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>At the Empire</i></div>

<p>We went once to the Empire, but it was
awfully stupid, and I never want to go again.
Being September, the boxes were empty, and
only a few of the orchestra stalls were taken,
but the gallery and the pit seemed full, and
the Aubrey Beardsley women were walking
about just as usual. But such a performance!
Blanche and I never laughed once
for the night; we were told afterwards that
you are not supposed to expect anything
funny at the first-class music halls now-a-days;
if you want to laugh you must go to
the cheap places. A fat woman in tights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and a stage smile had some performing parrots
and birds, and one or two people in
evening-dress, who have left the chorus of
the Opera to star, sang something, and there
was a huge ballet whose chief features appear
to be the time and cost it takes to produce&mdash;that
was all. You couldn't imagine
anything more deadly dull, and a man near
us slept all through the ballet. Blanche and
I felt utterly exhausted after it; it was so
boring. They say the Palace and the Alhambra
are not a bit different; only the
Palace, in place of the ballet has a Biograph,
which wiggles and makes you feel cross-eyed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>At Claridge's</i></div>

<p>We found it much jollier to spend the
evenings in the drawing-room at Claridge's.
I don't know why we came to such a place,
and I certainly never will again. There are
very few people stopping in the hotel, a
couple of Grand Dukes, some Americans,
and the Duchess of Rougemont, who is up
in town for a few days. This morning
Something Pasha, with a fez, arrived from
Cairo, and Eleanora, Countess of Merryone
and her boy husband. I am sure it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
is a love-match, for he won't let her out
of his sight, and looks at her as if she
were something good to eat. She must be
fully twenty-five years older than he and
looks it, for he hasn't a hair on his face,
and blushes when you speak to him. But
she keeps her youth, and when the Society
papers call her beautiful they speak the
truth for once.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Countess of Merryone</i></div>

<p>I remember her quite well when I was
your age; she was known then as the beautiful
Lady Merryone, and Society was divided
into two parties, one of which declared
that she was the most beautiful woman in
England, and the other that Mrs. Palsgrave
was. Their photographs were in all the
shop windows, and their portraits in every
Academy, and fashions were named after
them. There was the Palsgrave toque and
the Merryone bolero, and everything they
did was chronicled in the papers, just as if it
mattered. Each tried to outdo the other,
and Mrs. Palsgrave, who had the most beautiful
feet you ever saw out of marble, went
to an historical fancy-ball as Cleopatra, and
her feet were absolutely bare. Her portrait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
was afterwards painted in the costume, but it
was hung at the salon, as it was considered
too indecent for the Academy. And what a
sensation it was when Mr. Palsgrave blew
his brains out in the height of a London
Season, and left so many debts that Mrs.
Palsgrave to get rid of them went on the
stage, where a Serene Highness saw her and
fell in love with her, and married her. They
say you wouldn't recognise her now, she has
changed so; she lives somewhere in Germany
and is as grey as a badger and as red
as a lobster and bloated with beer.</p>

<p>But Eleanora, Countess of Merryone, is
still to the fore. Merryone, who was old
enough to be her grandfather, died of a fit
of jealousy; then she turned Roman Catholic
and went into a convent, but it sounds
better in books than it is in practice, and she
came out again in six months and married a
Bishop within a year of Merryone's death,
and buried him within another year. She
has been a Primrose Dame and a Temperance
lecturer and a Theosophist, and kept a
stud at Newmarket, and edited a daily, and
started for the North Pole but turned back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
at Iceland, and now she has married this
boy. And she isn't a lunatic at large, but a
woman who ought to have borne children,
and had cares and anxieties.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Disguising Age</i></div>

<p>It makes me feel quite old, when I think
of her and Mrs. Palsgrave, and see all the
changes of the last eighteen years. But I
won't think of time and the Burial Service
yet awhile. I saw Valmond in Piccadilly to-day,
and I believe I could catch him myself
if I tried, for I haven't got a grey hair, at
least Th&eacute;r&egrave;se manages to hide them; and
I haven't got a moustache, and my eyes
haven't got wrinkles round the corners, and
my neck hasn't begun to shrink. I am
only thirty-five, Elizabeth, and a Society
belle's star sets late.&mdash;Your dearest
Mamma.</p>

<h2>LETTER XIX</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Claridge's Hotel, London</span><br />
<span class="mr3">16th September</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>L'Affaire Colorado</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">We</span> met Sir Charles Bevon in Regent
Street this morning. He had just
arrived from the continent, and looked it,
for he wore a Glengarry cap and a yellow
and brown check travelling suit, and carried
on his arm a hideous ulster-looking thing
that had stripes all over it. He said he was
going to the Caf&eacute; Royal to lunch, and asked
us if we would join him, and, as we wanted
to hear what had happened at Lucerne after
we left, we accepted his invitation.</p>

<p>The Wertzelmanns' ball ended the season;
when Sir Charles left a week after us the
National was almost empty. The great sensation
that followed the ball was what he
called "l'affaire Colorado." You remember
my mentioning the angelically beautiful
creature stopping at Schloss Gessler?
Well, it seems Count Fosca gave a breakfast-party
at the G&uuml;tsch, and said in chaff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
that he believed Madame Colorado was
the "<i>dame voil&eacute;e</i>" of the Dreyfus Affair.
This was repeated, and Madame Colorado,
it seems, nearly died of mortification. Her
brother was telegraphed for, and he came
over at once from St. Moritz and challenged
Count Fosca. He was a tiny little man,
with red hair and a pale face, and looked
as if Fosca's pistols would blow him to
atoms. He asked Sir Charles and Mr.
Vanduzen to be his <i>t&eacute;moins</i>, but both of
course refused. Mr. Vanduzen got positively
funky, and said his Government
would take away his pension, if he had
anything to do with duelling. So Madame
Colorado's brother asked the Marquis and
the Vicomte, who jumped at the chance. I
don't know whom Fosca asked. The duel
excited no end of talk and scandal. The
most awful things were said about Madame
Colorado and Mr. Wertzelmann, and poor
Madame Colorado, who had had such
an unhappy marriage, and had thought of
entering a convent, was simply picked to
pieces. Every one made the <i>affaire</i> his
or her own business, and the Duchesse de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Vaudricourt declared that Madame Colorado
had behaved so badly with a priest
that the nuns wouldn't have her at any
price. The upshot of it all was that, after
the greatest publicity and scurrility, Count
Fosca apologised, said his words had been
entirely misquoted, that he had the greatest
respect for Madame Colorado, and he took
her brother and the <i>t&eacute;moins</i> over to Berne
in his automobile, and they all signed documents
before the French Minister.</p>

<p>Sir Charles said that after that, Madame
Colorado and her brother left Lucerne with
Mrs. Wertzelmann, and Mr. Wertzelmann
went to Berne to transact some diplomatic
business. Sir Charles left himself immediately
afterwards, and spent some days in
Paris, where he met the Vicomte, who told
him that Mrs. Isaacs had come back and
broken off the engagement between Rosalie
and Count Albert. As far as the Vicomte
could ascertain she had been to Vienna to
make enquiries about the Count, and found
out to her horror that he had a wife and
several children, and that he wasn't divorced.
Mrs. Johnson gave the Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
his <i>cong&eacute;</i> and threatened him with all sorts
of condign vengeance, but Sir Charles said
Count Albert probably laughed, as no
doubt it was not the first time he had
tried the same little game.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Society at Lucerne</i></div>

<p>It was fun for a fortnight, but I am sure
the society at Lucerne would have bored
me if I had stopped much longer. Of
course it hasn't got the backbone of ours at
home, and all sorts of people mix in it, as
you see, from millionaires to clerks. All
that is asked of one is to be amusing, and,
if you are an American, to spend your
money. Nobody knows anything really
about anybody else, and, as everybody wants
to be distracted, there are no scruples as to
the means employed. I should not like to
see Lucerne customs adopted in England,
but after all one meets the same sort of
people in London, and, to give the devil
his due, I believe that the Hotel National
set is no worse than Lord Valmond's or
Mrs. Smith's.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Domestics</i></div>

<p>Sir Charles thinks we ought to try a
winter at Rome. But I shall settle down
quietly at Monk's Folly for some time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
come. There is one thing I would willingly
exchange with our Continental friends, and
that is the domestics in our smart hotels.
Here, in England, they give themselves the
airs of royal servants, and condescend to
wait on us inferior mortals; they make me
feel positively uncomfortable with their impudent
solemnity. I hear Blanche warning
me from the next room not to miss the
train, so good-bye till I get home.&mdash;Your
dearest Mamma.</p>

<h2>LETTER XX</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Monk's Folly</span>, 18th September</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>At Home</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">Home</span> once more! I never knew how
much I had missed it till I got back.
I wonder how I ever left it, everything is so
comfortable and refined. I feel quite clean
again&mdash;I mean morally clean, and that's a
sensation that we in our station and particular
set get so seldom. I believe the return
to an English home is a moral douche. I
feel virtuous; I went to hear Mr. Frame
preach in the morning and almost went
again this evening. I half made up my
mind to put aside Paquin and make a guy
of myself, I felt so good; but a glimpse of
Lady Beatrice in church this morning with
a Taunton milliner's dream on her back, put
me off, and as soon as I had taken a tiny
blue pill and driven the hypochondria of
Lucerne dissipation away, I shall be my old
self again&mdash;the self you know, Elizabeth,
all Paquin and Henry Arthur Jones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Tipping</i></div>

<p>What an awful imposition tipping is.
Servants won't look at small change now-a-days,
and when I gave the boy who works
the lift five shillings, his "Thank you"
sounded just like "Damn you." Mrs.
Chevington, who came over this afternoon,
told me of an experience she had the last
time she was in town, but I am sure I
should never have had the courage to do
what she did. She was only three days in
some hotel in the West End; she had
tipped the chamber-maid, the man in the
lift, the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, the waiter, and sent
a half-sovereign in to the cook, and was
waiting for a hansom, when up rushed a
man she had never seen before to help her
into it. He took off his hat and was very
polite; hotel-porter was written all over
him, and she supposed she ought to tip
him, but said her gorge rose at it, as he had
never done anything for her. However,
she put a half-crown in his hat, and he never
said "Thank you," which made her so
savage that she took it back again. The
result was that at Paddington the cabman
thought she was stingy, and he was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
abusive that she had to call a policeman,
and compel the man to take the right fare.</p>

<p>But then Mrs. Chevington is masterful,
and doesn't mind attracting a crowd and
being insulted, while I should have fainted
with mortification. I am sending you a
cheque expressly for tips, for I know that in
country houses they are even more grasping
than in hotels. I wish Royalty would stop
it, for I don't think any other means will
ever avail.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Uneventful Things</i></div>

<p>Blanche came over to supper, and to spend
the night, for she said she wanted to talk of
the National and old times, and at home it
was nothing but tennis, bicycles, and church.
Things have been rather uneventful while
we were away; we missed some races at
Bath, to which the Parkers took a Pullman-full
of people. Lady Beatrice gave a dance,
and there was a Sunday-school feast at
Braxome, when the boys pulled up all of
Lady Beatrice's geraniums, and threw stones
on the roof of the stables for the fun of
hearing the horses plunge in the stalls, and,
to Mr. Frame's terror, when Lady Beatrice
scolded them, they made faces at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Monsieur Malorme</i></div>

<p>The Blaines have had to send away Monsieur
Malorme; he made love to Daisy, and
when she told him it was impertinent, he
was so cut up that one of the footmen found
him trying to hang himself with his handkerchief
from a nail in the wall of his room,
having first taken down a snow-storm that
Mrs. Elaine had painted when she was twelve.
But the only damage he succeeded in doing
was to put his foot through the canvas, and
pull down half the wall. The Blaines have
since heard that he did a similar thing when
coaching the Duke of FitzArthur. Since
then, Daisy has received threatening letters
in a female hand from Soho, giving her the
choice between being summoned as a co-respondent,
and paying ten guineas. Poor
Mrs. Blaine has been awfully upset about
it, and has put the matter in Mr. Rumple's
hands.</p>

<p>I don't think there is any more gossip to
tell you, save that Tom Carterville, who was
at Eton with Charlie Carriston, and went
out with the Yeomanry to South Africa, has
come back. Lady Beatrice is so glad to
have him home safe and sound that she intends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
to return thanks to the Almighty by
entertaining a good deal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Society Papers</i></div>

<p>Mrs. Chevington told me in the afternoon
that she had read in one of the Society
papers that the Smiths have taken a house
in Park Lane, and that Mr. Wertz, the
African millionaire you met at Nazeby, is
engaged to marry Cushla O'Cork, the Irish
agitatress. But then, you know, the Society
papers will say anything to fill up their
columns, and it must be so hard to find
something new and true every week. I like
your habit of always practising the <i>ing&eacute;nue</i>,
even in your letters to me, it helps you to
act it the better. I hope you will meet Lord
Valmond soon again, but of course you will,
as he is sure to be visiting at the same
houses. Write me all that happens, just as
I write to you. There is nothing so nice as
a letter full of what other people are doing.&mdash;Your
dearest Mamma.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXI</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Monk's Folly</span>, 29th October</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Hockey Season</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">The</span> hockey season has begun here,
and the game is played somewhere
every day. Of course, I only go to look
on, and can't imagine myself, in a short skirt
and thick boots, rushing about a damp
field. Yesterday the Blaines had a party,
and I have been having twinges of neuralgia
all day from it, for it was awfully wet and
cold. Mrs. Blaine and I sat on an iron
roller, till we were chilled to the bone.
There was a fog so thick that nobody knew
which side they belonged to, and Lady
Beatrice, who really at her age ought to
stop, got a blow on her forehead just above
the nose. The play only stopped a minute
for people to shout, "Dear Lady Beatrice,
hope you are not hurt!" and Tom Carterville
took advantage of the momentary distraction
to sneak a goal. Mrs. Blaine took
Lady Beatrice indoors, and, as Lady Beatrice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
described it to me, she filled a basin with
blood. She showed me her ankles, and
there wasn't a bit of white skin from the
knees down, but she said hockey was
great fun, and kept her in health. They
always put her to keep goal, for she is so fat
it is only one chance in a hundred that a ball
will pass her.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Father Ribbit</i></div>

<p>Father Ribbit came to look on, and
walked back to the house with me when the
match was over. He said tea was the best
part of hockey, and I agreed with him; he
tried nearly everything on the tea-table, and
talked with his mouth full of chocolate cake
about the price of incense. I really can't
understand how the Blaines go to his church,
but Blanche says it is on account of her
mother, who thinks Low Church schismatic.
You should have seen Father Ribbit glare
at Mr. Frame when he came into the room,
looking in his hockey things as if he had
been mending the roads. Father Ribbit
wears a silk neckcloth with I.H.S. embroidered
on it, and Blanche says he puts ashes
on his head in Holy Week. Mrs. Dorking,
who is a Roman Catholic, told me nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
made her laugh so much as a High Church
Anglican; they were always doing odd
things, which the Low Church people called
"Popish Practices," but in reality nothing
was more erroneous, and that she had heard
that no two Ritualist priests did the same
things. Mrs. Blaine had induced her once to
go to Father Ribbit's, and assured her she
wouldn't find any difference between her
own service and his. Mrs. Dorking said she
stuffed her handkerchief into her mouth to
keep from shrieking, for Father Ribbit
seemed to be making up rites as he went
along, and didn't at all look or act like a
real priest. Lady Beatrice, who happened
to overhear us, and looks on Rome and
Ritualism as the abomination of abomination,
said she wished Henry the Eighth was alive,
and that she would as soon think of inviting
"that Ribbit to Braxome as a play-actor."</p>

<p>Tom Carterville is much improved since
he went to South Africa. Before he went
out he was only an overgrown boy, but the
experience has made him quite manly. His
mother is always telling people in his hearing
what dangers he ran, and how brave he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
was. Like everybody else, she likes to play
Aunt Sally with the poor War Office, but her
grievance is that Tom hasn't been recommended
for the V.C. Tom declares he never
ran any danger at all, for he was never sent
to the front, and never saw a Boer the whole
time; and he didn't even get enteric, or
kicked by a horse. But Lady Beatrice fairly
beams, and says it's his modesty, and she
wishes he had been shut up in Ladysmith,
for she knows he would have found a way to
raise the siege, and Tom looks quite foolish,
and says, "Damn!"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Maid's Audacity</i></div>

<p>One of the maids at Braxome dressed up
in his khaki uniform the other day, and went
into the kitchen, where she frightened the
servants out of their wits at her audacity. It
seems Lady Beatrice went to the servants'
hall that day, a thing she has never been
known to do before, and arrived there in
time to hear the butler say to the maid:</p>

<p>"What would you do if Mr. Tom should
catch you in his uniform?" To which the
girl replied, suiting the action to her words,
"I should salute him!"</p>

<p>Tom, who told me the story and put a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
<i>double entendre</i> in it, like a horrid boy, said it
would be hard to say whether the servants
were more horrified to see his mother, or
his mother at the unheard-of fastness of
the upper housemaid, who, he added, was a
pretty little wench, and brought him his tea
in the mornings before he got out of bed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Troublesome Servants</i></div>

<p>I am almost inclined to make my peace
with those bores who are always talking servants.
Mine have been troubling me so
much lately that I feel quite martyrised. I
ordered the carriage to go to Taunton the
other morning, and got myself ready, when,
would you believe, that Perkins sent in to
say that I couldn't go, as the roads were too
heavy and the horses would slip! I sent
for him and implored him to relent, and he
finally let Alfred drive me in the dog-cart,
and Alfred drove so fast, I thought I should
be pitched out. I call it quite unkind of
Perkins, and he has been with us ten years
too. Then, again, the other morning Tom
Carterville came to ask me if I could lend
him any golf balls, and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se told me
afterwards that she found James peeping
through the keyhole, and when she remonstrated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
he threatened to blackmail me; now
I know why Lord Froom got rid of him,
and I have given him notice. But the worst
of all, Elizabeth, is the new page. You know
how hard it is to get one at all. Well,
finally, in despair, I followed Mrs. Chevington's
advice and sent to the workhouse in
Bath for a boy. They sent me such a pretty
little fellow, about twelve years old. I had
him measured for his livery, and he looked
such a dear in it, and was picking up his
duties so quickly, but I have had to send
him back to Bath to his workhouse. The
kitchen cat had kittens, and cook, very foolishly,
gave them to the boy, and told him
to get rid of them. Some little while later,
I heard a horrid miaouing on the lawn, and
went to the window to see what it was. I
found the new page digging a hole in the
geranium beds, and something sputtering
about in the earth. Fancy, Elizabeth, he
was burying the poor little kittens <i>alive</i>, the
little monster! Of course I couldn't keep
him after that, could I?</p>

<p>So you see, darling, even if you are a
pretty and rich widow, and only live for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Paquin and a good time, you still have your
troubles. Lady Beatrice says the question
of servants is more troublesome than Home
Rule, and I agree with her.</p>

<p>Give my love to Lady Theodosia, but
don't tell her that I am glad she doesn't live
in this part of the country.&mdash;Your dearest
Mamma.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Tom Carterville Calls</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">Tom Carterville</span> came again
this morning to ask if I would lend
him Jerry to ride to Wellington, as the
equestrian cook has lamed the three saddle-horses
at Braxome. I sent to ask Perkins
for permission, and after I got it, Tom
didn't seem in a hurry to go, and stopped
so long that I had to ask him to lunch, and
then he waited till tea. He is an amusing
boy, but I wish he didn't look so much
like his mother. When he is a little older
he is going to be enormous. You know
he was at Eton with Charlie Carriston, and
declares there wasn't a greater sneak in the
school.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Daintree Affair</i></div>

<p>I told him about Cora de la Haye and
the diamond necklace, and Tom says she is
just the sort of woman to make trouble, and
that Lady Carriston had better put on her
life-preserver, for there is going to be a storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of Charlie's brewing. He told me all about
the Daintree affair; he called Daintree a rotter,
and says he will never marry the girl.</p>

<p>You know Lady Daintree went to the
War Office herself, and refused to leave till
they promised to order Daintree out to
South Africa at once. The girl is suing for
breach of promise,&mdash;ten thousand pounds
damages,&mdash;Tom says that the Daintree
barony will never stand it, for it hasn't
recovered from the late lord's plunging on
the turf. He says that Connie Metcalfe is
good enough for Daintree, who is an awful
mug, and that a Gaiety girl would make as
good a ladyship as a <i>coryph&eacute;e</i> at the Empire.
It seems to me that Lady Daintree is herself
to blame for it all; if she had used tact
with her son and brought him up sensibly,
she wouldn't have to eat her pride now.</p>

<p>I asked Tom if he intended to follow the
fashion and marry in the theatrical world,
and have Lady Beatrice begging the War
Office to send him to the Front, so that he
might die sooner than disgrace her. He
looked at me with a queer expression and
said he preferred to follow the other fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
now in vogue, and marry a beauty twice his
age. I told him I believed he was thinking
of Miss Tancred of Exeter, the temperance
lecturer, who read "L'Assommoir" to the
Braxome tenantry last week, and who wears
short hair, green goggles and a bicycle skirt,
and is fifty, if she is a day. Tom laughed,
and said I had hit the right nail on the head.
A jolly youngster, and might do for you,
Elizabeth, if Valmond turns sour. He will
have Braxome and twenty thousand a year
when Lady Beatrice dies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Dinner at Astley Court</i></div>

<p>To-night I dined at Astley Court; the
Parkers have a large house-party. Miss
Parker is to marry Clandevil in ten days,
the invitations have been out some time; it
is to be a very grand affair. Both she and
the Duke appear bored with one another
already, and Mr. Parker has been heard to
say to a compatriot that his daughter had
made him promise her a title, and that he
had bought her an English duke; it was a
bit off colour, but good at the price.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An Odious Man</i></div>

<p>I went in to dinner with an odious man,
a Mr. Sweetson; he is Mr. Parker's partner
in America, and was so patronising. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
wore a button with the American flag on it,
just like Mr. Wertzelmann the night of the
ball at Schloss Gessler, and underneath it
there was another one of white enamel with
"Let her go, Gallagher," in black letters
on it. I wonder what it could have meant;
I would have asked him, but I thought it
might seem rude. The people at Croixmare
couldn't have eaten worse than Mr. Sweetson;
he put his napkin in his collar, and it
was well he did, for he spilled his soup all
over it, and he sucked his teeth when he had
finished. I asked him what he thought of
England, and he replied that he preferred to
spend his money in his own country, and
couldn't see how a man like Mr. Parker,
who had the brains to make the big fortune
he had, could settle down in one of the
effete countries of the Old World. And he
added if he had his way he would put the
Monroe Doctrine into force and drive Europe
altogether out of America. He became
quite <i>farouche</i>, and I am sure he is
an Irish-American, for they say they hate
us more than the other Americans. Algy
Chevington told me that Mr. Sweetson is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
a Tammany Tiger, whatever that is; at any
rate it isn't anything nice, and I am sure
Mr. Parker had better put him to eat in the
servants' hall hereafter. He is some relation
to Mrs. Parker, for he called her Cousin
Petunia; Clandevil looked as if he could
have strangled him, and Algy says Mr.
Parker must have put down millions in
hard cash, or Clandevil would never go
through with the marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. Sweetson stepped on Lady Beatrice's
yellow brocade after dinner, and ripped out
fully a yard of stitches. You should have
seen the glance she gave him; it was more
terrible than the one she bestowed on Mr.
Frame the day he was unlucky enough to
beat her at tennis. Mr. Sweetson was awfully
embarrassed; if it had been anyone
less objectionable, I should have felt sorry
for him. He only made matters worse by
asking her what it cost, for he would send
her ladyship a dress the following day at
double the price. Lady Beatrice put up
her <i>pince-nez</i>, and stared at him without
uttering a word; then she sailed across the
room and sat down beside Mrs. Chevington.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
"Cousin Petunia" told Mr. Sweetson
that if he wanted to smoke, he would find
the gentlemen in the billiard-room. He
took the hint.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mrs. Dot</i></div>

<p>Tom Carterville came and sat down next
to me, and made me nearly choke with
the funny things he said about the Parkers,
and he believes his mother will drop them.
There is such a garrulous old lady stopping
at Astley, Mrs. Dot; Tom took her in to
supper. She came across the room and
joined us. She began to talk about the
nobility, and told us she considered she
belonged to it, for though she was an
American, she could trace her ancestry back
to the Scottish Chiefs, and she asked Tom
what he thought it would cost to have
Burke put her in the peerage among the
collateral branches. Then she told us she
was descended also from Admiral Coligny.
Poor dear Coligny, she called him, and she
certainly would have been a Roman Catholic,
if it hadn't been for Coligny. Tom
asked her quite innocently if she had left
Coligny in America, and when he intended
to come over. "When he comes to Astley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Mrs. Dot," he said, "be sure you let me
know, I'll give him a run with the West
Somerset Harriers."</p>

<p>"He's <i>dead</i>! Mr. Carterville," she
fairly shrieked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon," he said. "I
thought from the way you spoke that he
was in New York or Chicago, making
money like all nice Americans."</p>

<p>"Oh, is it possible, Mr. Carterville," she
went on, "that you have never heard of
Coligny, poor dear Coligny, who was killed
in the St. Bartholomew Massacre!"</p>

<p>"With all due respect to your relation,"
Tom said, "I never heard of the sad catastrophe;
I don't read any but the sporting
papers. I suppose the what-do-you-call-it
massacre was in one of your little wars on
the frontier. I hope they didn't get his
scalp, Mrs. Dot."</p>

<p>Miss Parker, who was sitting quite near
and heard every word, turned round and
said, "Don't you see they are making fun
of you, Aunt?" Mrs. Dot turned very
red and simpered, and Tom and I felt as
if we were looking for the North Pole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>I do call it unkind for people to make
you feel uncomfortable in their houses.
These Parkers are not at all like the Wertzelmanns
and the other Americans I met at
Lucerne. And I am sure if Lady Beatrice
does call on them, that Lady Archibald
Fairoaks and the Marchioness of Runymede,
who are the nicest kind of Americans,
wouldn't. Good-night, darling, I shall expect
to hear from you to-morrow.&mdash;Your
dearest Mamma.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><i>Novel-reading Servants</i></div>

<p><i>P. S.</i>&mdash;When I got back from Astley
to-night, I had the greatest difficulty to get
into the house. No one answered the bell,
and finally Perkins, who has a key to the
kitchen, let me in that way. I went into
the dining-room and rang and called; still
no one came. I then went upstairs and
found Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, the two maids, the cook,
and the new page, sitting round a blazing
wood fire in my bed-room, and cook was
reading "The Master Christian" to them
aloud!</p>

<p>I cried from pure vexation, for one can't
send all one's servants away at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
time. I am sure I can't see why the lower
classes should have novelists, but they have
everything just like us now-a-days. And
when I was in town last month, at Claridge's,
the Duchess of Rougemont told me she
didn't know what the world was coming to,
for her maid belonged to a Corelli Society,
and she had actually sat next her own footman
at a Paderewski Recital the last time
the pianist was in London.</p>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Monk's Folly</span>, 2nd November</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Theatricals</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">The</span> Blaines had some theatricals yesterday
in St. Leo's school-house, to
raise money to give Father Ribbit a host.
In spite of the weather being horrid I went.
They acted "My Lord in Livery," and a
manager came down from a West End
theatre to stage it. They only cleared two
guineas when all expenses were paid, which
of course won't buy a host, though Mrs.
Blaine suggested they might find a second-hand
one cheap in an old curiosity shop.
I thought the acting was atrocious, but they
were all mightily pleased with themselves,
and are now thinking of playing "The
Second Mrs. Tanqueray," and renting the
Taunton theatre. But that is always the way
with amateurs.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Church and Theatricals</i></div>

<p>Lady Beatrice is getting up tableaux at
Braxome in opposition, and Mr. Frame
came to-day to ask me to help. Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
brought me a nice note from his mother,
imploring me to say Yes, and I have consented,
and there is to be a lunch at Braxome
to-morrow to decide on what we shall
do. Lady Beatrice says she feels it her
duty to use all her influence with the Bishop
to have Father Ribbit tried by the Ecclesiastical
Court. There is every sign of a
church war, for Mrs. Blaine declares she
will write to her uncle, who is in the
Cabinet, to back up Father Ribbit. And
it's nothing but church and theatricals; as
you know down here in the country it is
always church and something else. I shall
do all I can to fan the fire, and Tom has
promised to help me, for we are so terribly
dull, anything will serve to wake us up a
bit.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The De Mantons</i></div>

<p>I have called on the Vane-Corduroys,
who have leased Shotover Park from the De
Mantons. Poor Lady de Manton cried
when she left it, and is living in a boarding-house
on the Parade at Weston-super-mare;
old Lord de Manton has gone up to London,
where he thinks he can get a Chairmanship
of a City Company for the sake of his name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
The Honourable Agatha has gone out to
South Africa on a hospital ship, and her
brother, the Honourable de Montgomery
de Manton, whom, you remember, we met
once on the Promenade at Cannes, and I
wouldn't let you bow to him because he was
walking with such an impossible woman, has
joined the Imperial Yeomanry as a trooper.
The family seems quite broken up; it is
rather a pity, as they had been at Shotover
since the Conquest. Mrs. Blaine says it is
all due to Kaffirs; that Lord de Manton
would set up as a stockbroker, and you
know what a mess he got the lunatic asylum
accounts into the year he was treasurer.
But, as Mrs. Blaine says, he will probably
be back at Shotover within a year, for he is
just the sort of man they like to get on
directorates in London, and that is such a
paying profession now-a-days. He told
Lady Beatrice that if worse became worst
with him he knew the Colonial Office
would give him an island to govern. He
didn't seem very depressed when he left, but
Lady de Manton was completely <i>boulevers&eacute;e</i>.
Tom told me that she had written to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
mother to say that Weston-super-mare was
intolerable; they gave her Brussels sprouts
and boiled beef six days running; she
wanted Lady Beatrice to help her get the
post of stewardess on one of the new West
Indian line steamers to Jamaica; she makes
a point of the fact that she was never sick
when crossing the Channel. She seems
willing to do anything till poor Lord de
Manton "arrives."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Vane-Corduroys</i></div>

<p>How I digress! I started to tell you of
the Vane-Corduroys, and I shunted off to
the De Mantons; you will think me as
garrulous as an old maid.</p>

<p>I don't know how the Vane-Corduroys
got their money, but I think it was out of
"Sparklets," though Tom says he is sure
he has seen "Corduroy's Lung Tonic" on
the signboards at the Underground stations.
Lady Beatrice, who takes up every new person
out of sheer curiosity, called, and of
course everybody else had to. But Lady
Beatrice, who always has a reason for everything
she does, said that she did it for Lady
de Manton's sake, who had told her that if
the Vane-Corduroys were properly <i>rang&eacute;</i>, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
would help Lord de Manton in the City.
Mr. Vane-Corduroy is the very type of a
company-promoter; you know what I mean&mdash;they
are always paunchy, and wear frock-coats,
and top-hats, and have a President-of-a-Republic
air. Mrs. Vane-Corduroy has
dyed hair, the colour of tawny port, and she
dresses like the ready-made models at Peter
Robinson's. She looks exactly like a doll,
and all the time I was talking to her, I felt
that if I pinched her waist, she would say
"Made in England." I am sure you wind
her up with a key. They have completely
changed the drawing-room at Shotover&mdash;you
remember what a splendid air there was
about it, with the old, worm-eaten Flemish
tapestry, and the oak panelling&mdash;well, they
have had the upholsterers down from
Maple's, and it is now spick-and-span Louis
Quinze; there are foot-stools in front of all
the chairs, and the De Manton ancestors
have all got new gilt frames. They have
two children, a boy and a girl. The girl is
about twelve, and has a French governess,
a strange-looking woman, something like
Louise Michel, with a moustache. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Vane-Corduroy told me she had the highest
references, and that she had come to them
from a Russian Grand-Duke's family. The
boy is at Eton.</p>

<p>I asked them how they thought they
would like Somersetshire. Mrs. Vane-Corduroy
said she missed town&mdash;there was
no Church Parade, no Prince's, no Bond
Street, and no dear little Dog Cemetery,
like the one in the Park. She thought the
latter was such a peaceful spot, and she felt
quite happy to think that Fido would rest
there till the Resurrection, under his little
Carrara marble cross. It was evidently a
very depressing subject, and Mr. Vane-Corduroy
hastened to change it by saying
that his wife found the country a bit lonely
just at first, but people had been very kind
in calling on them, and that he was sure they
would like it immensely, as he intended to
fill the house with people from town, and
that they should always spend the season at
their house in Grosvenor Square, and part
of the winter at Nice; and when they were
not visiting, they would either be yachting,
or at their shooting-box in the highlands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
In fact, he gave me to understand that they
would probably never be more than a couple
of months in the year at Shotover.</p>

<p>They have taken seats at Father Ribbit's,
and they have subscribed most liberally to
all the local charities. I must say I think it
rather an imposition, for they hadn't been
in the county a week, before they were
inundated with appeals for money; but, as
Lady Beatrice says, that if such people will
mix in our set, they must pay for it, and besides,
their names and the sums they give
are published in the Taunton papers, so that
it is not as if they were not getting any
return for their money.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Eulogy</i></div>

<p>I suppose it does pay in the end, for the
Rector of St. William's preached a regular
eulogy on Mr. Parker last Sunday, who is
restoring the whole church, for he found
some old dilapidated tablets in it with
"Parker" on them, and he is sure they are
his ancestors. He had a letter of thanks
from the Bishop about it, and the <i>Times</i>
devoted a column to it; said it was such
things that drew America and England together,
and that Mr. Parker's love of architecture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
was only equalled by his knowledge
of it, and that St. William's restored would
be an everlasting monument, in Early
English Gothic, to his memory. And I
don't believe Mr. Parker knows a gargoyle
from a reredos.</p>

<p>I must stop now, darling, for Mrs.
Chevington has just called, and I must go
down and see her. I shall expect to hear
from you to-morrow.&mdash;Your dearest
Mamma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Frightful Thing</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">Such</span> a frightful thing happened yesterday.
The Vane-Corduroys came to
return my call in their motor-car, and it
blew up at the front door. One of the
wheels fell into the conservatory, and the
groom was picked up insensible on the lawn.
He had to be brought into the house, where
he has been ever since, and is likely to be
for some days, for Dr. Smart says if he
is moved in his present state he will die.
Fortunately for the Vane-Corduroys they
had just entered the house, or they might
have been killed. You never heard such a
noise; it sounded like a cannonade, and
Perkins says it will cost me at least one
hundred pounds to repair the damage. The
Vane-Corduroys apologised profusely, and
looked as if they wished they had been blown
up along with the groom to hide their confusion.
Perkins and the gardener have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
been picking up bits of motor-car all over
the grounds to-day. I had to send the
Vane-Corduroys back to Shotover in the
victoria.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Rehearsal of Tableaux</i></div>

<p>We had a rehearsal of the tableaux at
Braxome in the evening. Lady Beatrice
looked absurd as Britannia; she posed herself
after the tail of a penny; Mr. Parker
as Uncle Sam, and Mr. Vane-Corduroy as
John Bull, shaking hands, were quite good,
but Mr. Frame, who was working the red,
white, and blue light, set fire to himself, and
might have been burned to death, but for
his presence of mind. He put himself out
by wrapping himself in Lady Beatrice's
Gobelin tapestry, which she had specially
made in Paris last year. You should have
seen Lady Beatrice's face, and she called him
"Frame," as she always does when she is
angry with him, and she told him he might
have waited till they brought some water
to throw over him. Mrs. Vane-Corduroy,
as Lady Macbeth going to murder Duncan,
would have been effective, if she hadn't
laughed in the middle of it. Everybody
said that Tom and I in "The Black Brunswicker's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Farewell" were the best, but Tom
squeezed me so, I could hardly breathe,
and when the curtain dropped he said we
must do it over again for an encore.</p>

<p>We think the tableaux will be a great success,
for all the tickets on sale at Mr. Dill's,
the chemist, have been sold, and he wrote
to ask Lady Beatrice if he could have some
more printed. Mrs. Parker told Lady
Beatrice it was awfully good of her to give
her drawing-room over to the "peasantry,"
as she calls the Taunton people.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An Excellent Chef</i></div>

<p>To-day the Vane-Corduroys had a lunch-party.
They have an excellent <i>chef</i>. Mr.
Vane-Corduroy said he was five years with
the Duchess of Rougemont, and only left
because the Duchess refused to pay for the
tuning of his piano. I think the Vane-Corduroys
are afraid of him. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se tells
me that he has a room fitted up as a studio
at Shotover, and that he exhibits every year
at the Salon, and only cooks from the love
of it. He has his meals in his own apartments.
Mrs. Vane-Corduroy showed me
several photographs of Fido, and one of his
grave in the Dog Cemetery; he was run over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
by a 'bus in the Bayswater road; and Mrs.
Vane-Corduroy shed tears when she told me
of it, and she said she went into mourning
for him for three months, and a Royal
Academician is at present at work on his
portrait from one of the photographs. She
intends to have it hung in the Academy next
year, and when I suggested that sometimes
the best pictures of the best artists were rejected,
she said that Mr. Vane-Corduroy
had seen about it already, for he had put the
Duke of Rougemont on to something good
in the City, and the Duke had promised
that he would see the picture was hung, and
not skied either.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Two Visitors</i></div>

<p>Two women are visiting at Shotover,
friends of Mrs. Vane-Corduroy. They look
as if they were made at Marshall &amp; Snelgrove;
they wore pearl necklaces over their
tailor-made walking suits, and long gold
chains with uncut sapphires, and their fingers
are covered in rings. I forget what Mrs.
Vane-Corduroy called them, but she said
they were old friends of hers, and such
clever girls. It seems they were left rather
poorly off, and to gain a living began by giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
dancing lessons to some people in Maida
Vale. They succeeded so well that they
now have an "Academy" in Mayfair, and
go about the country as well, giving private
instruction; their brother had a gymnasium
in Brighton, but got the war fever at Ladysmith
time, and went out to the front in
Paget's Horse, and the sisters are now running
the gymnasium&mdash;a School for Physical
Culture, Mrs. Vane-Corduroy called it. She
says that is why they know so many people
we do, Elizabeth, for they spoke of Lord
Valmond, and Mr. Wertz, and the Smiths,
and the Duke of Clandevil, as if they were
on quite intimate terms with them. I have
no doubt it is very creditable of them to
earn their living, but it seems strange to
meet them in Society. Really everything
is changing now-a-days. I am thinking of
telling Lady Beatrice and suggesting to her
that they should do Indian clubs or cannon
balls after the tableaux, and it would be
quite easy to get out a man from Taunton
to put up a trapeze in the drawing-room at
Braxome.&mdash;With love from your dearest
Mamma.</p>

believe he bought all the copper in the world,
and that the value of the common or garden
penny will go up. Mrs. Dot came, and after
what happened the other night at Astley, I
was particularly civil to her. She was quite
good-natured, and took the olive branch.
She asked me if I could recommend a dentist
in Taunton; it seems that when she
goes to bed she always puts her false teeth
in a glass of water, and one of the maids
threw them away in the slops by mistake.
Fortunately she keeps two sets, upper and
lower, but the spare plate was made in a
great hurry and bruises her gums. I told
her Fellowes in Taunton advertised to make
a set while you wait, but I didn't know how
long he made you wait, and she is going to
him to-day. She told me a story about a
Baron Finck von Finckelstein whom she
met in America, quite by chance, in a restaurant
where he was a waiter. The Baron has
a ruin on the Rhine, and the family had
become so impoverished that he decided to
go to America, where he landed literally in
his shirt-sleeves, and on account of his elegant
manners, Mrs. Dot said, he of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
got a situation as waiter in a restaurant; and
the proprietor made an awfully good thing
out of him, for he got one of the New York
Sunday papers to devote a column to the
Baron and the restaurant. It was a capital
advertisement; the article was illustrated, and
there were cuts of Schloss Finckelstein, the
ruin on the Rhine, of the Baron as he landed
in New York, of the Baron waiting in the
restaurant, and of the proprietor. Mrs. Dot
said that there was such a rush for tables that
one had to go awfully early to get one, and
that the Baron must have made quite a good
thing out of it, for nobody would have dared
give him less than a dollar tip. As the Baron
couldn't wait on everybody, the proprietor
had <i>&eacute;dition de luxe</i> menus printed with the
Finckelstein twenty-four quarterings on them
which you could take away as souvenirs. And
Tom Carterville, who was sitting next to me,
said he knew the De Mantons had made a
mistake in not going to America. Mrs. Dot
quite jumped at the idea; she knew the family
would do well, and that they would very
likely get an engagement all together to travel
about the country with Barnum's. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
sure that a whole family of Norman Conquest
aristocrats would draw just like the Baby
Venus or the Missing Link. Tom looked
sheepish, and I believe Mrs. Dot is not as
simple as she seems, and was getting at him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Subscription Ball</i></div>

<p>There is a subscription ball at the Carterville
Arms in Taunton to-night. The
tickets are four shillings. Lady Beatrice is
the patroness, and the money will be given
to the Soldiers' Widows' and Orphans'
Fund. Of course everybody will go, and
Paquin sent me such a dream of a frock
this morning. I wish you could meet me
in town next week for the Clandevil-Parker
wedding, but of course if Lord Valmond is
in your neighbourhood it would be folly
for you to leave. I have written to Octavia
to bring him to the scratch. She is
so clever and such a dear, and knows how
to help you just as if I myself were with
you. I am expecting daily to hear you
have caught him. Best of luck from&mdash;Your
dearest Mamma.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An Accident</i></div>

<p><i>P. S.</i> 6.30 <span class="smcapl">P.M.</span>&mdash;Mrs. Chevington came
to tea this afternoon and brought the news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
that Mr. Vane-Corduroy was rabbit shooting
this morning and blew off two of his fingers.
It seems his man gave him ball cartridge by
mistake, and the bullet hit Lady Beatrice's
horse as she was driving past the field in
which Mr. Vane-Corduroy was shooting at
the time of the accident. Poor Lady Beatrice
was frightened out of her wits, and
Mr. Vane-Corduroy, who saw her passing
and heard her scream, thought he had
killed her. Mrs. Chevington says she
thinks the Vane-Corduroys were more worried
over killing Lady Beatrice's horse than
over Mr. Vane-Corduroy's missing fingers.
Mrs. Vane-Corduroy at once despatched
a note to Braxome, full of the profoundest
apologies, and saying they had taken the
liberty of wiring instantly to Tattersall's to
send down a horse to replace the one Mr.
Vane-Corduroy was so unfortunate as to
kill. Mrs. Chevington was at Braxome
when the letter arrived. She says Tom
told his mother that she should accept the
new horse, as it would be undoubtedly superior
to the old crock that jogged her
about the country, and he thought that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
before Cockney millionaires turned country
gentlemen they ought to take lessons at
a shooting gallery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Ball</i></div>

<p><i>P. S. S.</i> 2.30 <span class="smcapl">A.M.</span>&mdash;I have just got home
from the ball at the Carterville Arms, and
as I find your letter has not been posted,
and I am not very sleepy, I will add a
postscript to it before going to sleep.</p>

<p>The ball was a financial success, and the
Mayor told Lady Beatrice her patronage
was invaluable. He took her in to supper,
and in his speech he spoke of nothing but
her ladyship's virtues. As Tom said, he
made you feel that the ball had been given
expressly for her benefit, and not at all
for the Soldiers' Widows and Orphans.
Of course, the Vane-Corduroys were not
present, and there was an alarming rumour
at one time that Mr. Vane-Corduroy was
bleeding to death. Everybody came up to
Lady Beatrice, and congratulated her on
her narrow escape. In fact, at supper the
Mayor quite drew tears to the Taunton
people's eyes when he referred to it. Lady
Beatrice tried to look unconcerned, as if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
deprecated the Mayor's fine compliments,
but when in a faltering voice he declared
how the whole countryside would miss
"good, honest, steady old Jock, who had
for so many years drawn her ladyship about
on her errands of mercy," Lady Beatrice
burst into tears, and the Mayor became
so affected at the havoc he had wrought,
that he wished "the bullet of the London
mushroom" (poor Mr. Vane-Corduroy
bleeding to death at Shotover!) had lodged
in his own magisterial breast. Mr. Parker
whispered to me that the Veuve Clicquot
was sweeter than usual.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Tom Proposes</i></div>

<p>There was a da&iuml;s at one end of the ball-room,
and here Lady Beatrice received the
"can&iuml;le" as Mr. Parker expressed it. She
wore purple velvet and amethysts, and
looked perfectly monstrous, and the room
was so hot that beads of perspiration formed
on her temples, and made little lanes in the
rouge on her cheeks. Nevertheless, in spite
of her appearance, Lady Beatrice can be
quite <i>grande dame</i> when she wishes, and she
did the honours of the evening in the most
dignified way. And I suppose if you are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
duke's daughter, and have such a place as
Braxome Towers and twenty thousand a
year, you can afford to look like a scarecrow.
The floors were awfully good, and all my
partners danced well. But, would you believe
it, that silly boy, Tom Carterville,
actually proposed to me, and was quite
serious about it too! We were sitting in
a sort of ante-room by ourselves, and Tom,
who is anything but shy, suddenly became
as awkward and bashful as a school-girl, and
blurted out how madly he loved me, and
had ever since he saw me at Braxome the
day he got back from South Africa. He
looked just like his mother, and I could
hardly keep from laughing, and tried to
turn all he said into a joke. Then he got
quite hot and perspiry and breathed hard,
and he begged me to accept him; he had
never loved any one as he did me, and he
didn't ever think of or mind the difference
in our ages. He acted just like they do in
Miss Braddon, and accused me of having
given him every encouragement, and wondered
how God could make a woman so
fair and so false. He took me by the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and looked into my eyes, then dropped them
and groaned, and wished they'd sent him to
the Front in South Africa. I knew he
meant all he said too, because he was so
earnest, and I could have half pitied him
if he hadn't looked so much like Lady
Beatrice. He made me feel so uncomfortable,
for I thought someone would come
into the room every minute, and I begged
him to take me back to the ball-room and
not be a silly boy. He laughed such a
queer laugh; it had a sort of sob in it, and
he said quite fiercely that I didn't know
how I had wounded him, but that he loved
me all the same, and that if he remained in
Somersetshire and was near me all the time,
the wound would never heal; and he intends
to go out to South Africa at once, and
is going up to London to-morrow, for he
wanted plenty of action and excitement and
danger to help him pull himself together
again.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Tom Rejected</i></div>

<p>I begged him on no account, if he loved
me, to tell his mother, for she would never
speak to me again. He said, did I really
have such a poor opinion of him, and it hurt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
him cruelly, for he was a gentleman and a
man of honour. I told him he could kiss
me just once, if he liked, for he was so very
much in earnest, and that we should part
friends. But he wouldn't, for he said the
memory of it would haunt him.</p>

<p>When we got back to the ball-room people
stared at us awfully hard, and I heard that
odious Mrs. Fordythe tell someone, "He is
too good for that frivolous little Paquin
doll." I am sure she meant me. I do wish
boys wouldn't fall in love with one, for they
are so serious and earnest and masterful, and
make one feel as if one had really done them
an injury. I whispered to Tom before he
left me, right in the midst of a horrid lot of
frumpy chaperones, that I hoped he would
come back safe from South Africa, and he
said I was rubbing it in, and he hoped the
first bullet would strike home. I really
thought someone would hear, he spoke so
loud. And there is no telling, Elizabeth, if
Tom had been older and not so much like
his mother, I might have taken him, for
Braxome and twenty thousand a year are not
to be found at one's feet every day. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
as it is, it is quite out of the question,
and I charge you not to mention a word of
this to anyone, for it would be sure to get
back here, and people say such nasty things.
Good-night.&mdash;Your dearest Mamma.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Monk's Folly</span>, 8th November</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Typhoid Fever</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">Mrs. Blaine</span> and six others of
Father Ribbit's flock are down
with typhoid fever. Dr. Smart and the
sanitary inspector have traced it to the Communion
wine at St. Leo's. The London
papers have got hold of the story, and yesterday's
<i>Daily Sensation</i> had an article on it
headed "Bacteria in the Chalice," "Typhoid
in a Cup of Holy Wine." Mr. Parker says it
beats anything he ever read in an American
paper, and thinks we have nothing more to
learn in that line from Yankee journalism.
Naturally it has been a nasty knock for the
Ritualists, and will frighten people away from
the sacrament at St. Leo's. Father Ribbit
wrote to the Taunton papers to-day about it,
and said that he will henceforth advocate the
"separate vessel" system, which he understands
is in vogue in America, and he is
soliciting subscriptions for fifty chalices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>At Mr. Frame's, Lady Beatrice, to whom
the cup is always passed first, set the fashion
of wiping the rim with her handkerchief,
which precaution has, till the present, been
efficacious. The Chevingtons, the Blaines,
and the best families who go to St. Leo's,
are going to provide their own communion
cups, but, as Mr. Parker said, it will be
interesting to note the strength of Father
Ribbit's head, for he has to drink all the
wine that is left over that not a drop may
be wasted, as of course it is sacred. Altogether,
the typhoid at St. Leo's has opened
some curious speculation, and has for the
moment put all other topics out of consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. Vane-Corduroy has been pronounced
out of danger; his mangled fingers have
been successfully amputated. He will not
be able to go up to town to-morrow to the
wedding of Miss Parker, but the doctor says
he must go to the Riviera for a change as
soon as possible, as the shock to his system
has been a great one. So after this week
Shotover will be shut up.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Tom Enlists</i></div>

<p>Tom Carterville left for London the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
after the ball, as he said, and Lady Beatrice
was in consternation on getting a telegram
from him saying he would sail for the Cape
in the new draft of Yeomanry in a week's
time. As I feel that I am in a measure
responsible for the grief at Braxome and
Tom's exile, I wrote him a nice little note
to-day, and enclosed a bunch of forget-me-nots
and my photo.</p>

<p>I hardly see anything of Blanche now-a-days;
since she and Daisy have taken up
theatricals so seriously they have no time
for dropping in for tea as they used. Of
course, now that Mrs. Blaine is ill, they will
be busier than ever, though Mrs. Chevington,
who was here this morning, says that
they are both still at work rehearsing the
"Second Mrs. Tanqueray." Daisy's head
seems quite turned by the praise she got in
that non-professional drawing-room thing,
"My Lord in Livery." She told Mrs.
Chevington she always knew she had acting
in her, and she wants to go up to London
and go on the stage. But that is always the
way with amateurs. They begin with one
of these pieces peculiar to Church entertainments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
that one never sees, save in country
school-rooms, and they immediately afterwards
try Sheridan or Pinero. One hardly
knows which is duller to watch.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Droll Performance</i></div>

<p>And talking of plays reminds me that I
was particularly asked by Lady Beatrice to
go to the Taunton Orphan Asylum this
afternoon and see the children do "The
Merchant of Venice." It was the drollest
performance I ever remember attending.
When I got there I found two long files,
one of boys, the other of girls, waiting in a
corridor outside of the hall. A caretaker,
with a nose like Job Trotter's, was keeping
the "sexes separated," and the children, who
were anywhere from five years of age up to
ten, were jabbering like a lot of rooks. I
instinctively wondered what would happen
if Mr. Trotter's authority was withdrawn for a
few minutes. While I waited for the door of
the hall to be opened, Lady Beatrice and the
matron arrived, and Lady Beatrice, who wore
a sort of short bicycle skirt, and a felt hat
with a pheasant's feather in it, and looked as
if she ought to have carried a bunch of edelweiss
and an alpenstock with a chamois-horn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
handle, exclaimed, in her voice which
is always down in her boots:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, my little dears! Each good little
boy and girl is going to be given an apple
and a bun, and each bad little boy and girl
will get a slice of bread without any butter.
Now I hope you will all be good little boys
and girls."</p>

<p>"Yes, please, ladyship," they all piped in
unison, and the matron let us all into the
hall.</p>

<p>I don't know whether it was droller to
watch the brats murder Shakespeare, or the
marked interest taken in the performance by
Lady Beatrice, the matron, and some of the
patronesses. Shylock was too absurd; he
was about ten and wore a funny little goatee.
He nor any of the others understood a word
of what they were saying; they had learnt it
by heart like the alphabet, and recited it in
shrill sing-song. When Master Shylock
called for the scales, they brought him a pair
such as you see in doll's houses, and when
he sharpened his little knife, Lady Beatrice's
"little dears" stood up in their seats with
excitement and squeaked like a lot of guinea-pigs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
But even more comical than the children
mouthing Shakespeare was the fact of
the stage-manager of a London theatre, that
Lady Beatrice has had down once a week
for the last two months to coach the little
actors, coming before the curtain and making
a speech, in which he told a lie that was so
big I should have thought he would have
been afraid he would be struck down like
Ananias. He had the cheek to tell us
that the Shylock with the goatee and the
doll's scales was an undeveloped Roscius&mdash;and
Lady Beatrice and the matron believed
him.</p>

<p>The matron told me that Shakespeare was
such a refining influence and that the children
were so much improved by his plays,
and she was quite horrified when I replied I
thought a pantomime would do them more
good. After the performance the "little
dears" sat down at long tables and devoured
apples and buns, and squeaked like guinea-pigs.</p>

<p>Lady Beatrice said it was a huge success,
and that they would try, "As You Like It,"
next year. When Mr. Parker said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Britons as a race had no sense of humour
Lady Beatrice should have told him to go
with me to see her "little dears" interpret
Shakespeare. I am sure he would have
changed his mind.&mdash;Your dearest Mamma.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Monk's Folly</span>, 11th November</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Doraines</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">Am</span> so glad to hear Valmond has turned
up at Chevenix Castle. You have it
all your own way now. I hear it was the
Doraines who gave the Vane-Corduroys their
first start last year. It seems the Doraines
were in awfully low water and at their wit's
ends what to do. Mrs. Chevington says
they had almost decided to go to Boulogne
when Lord Doraine met Sir Dennis O'Desmond
and advised them to go to Bayswater,
for he said that three months there had
pulled him straight. It seems you take a
house in a terrace, go to the nearest church,
and buy groceries and meat in the neighbourhood,
and everybody calls. That's the
way the Doraines found the Vane-Corduroys.
Mrs. Vane-Corduroy was presented by Lady
Doraine; it cost an enormous sum, and Lord
Doraine told Algy Chevington he was making
quite a tidy income in Bayswater terraces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
I should think Lord de Manton might follow
his example, but I suppose he is too old
for Society. Lady de Manton has gone up
to London to him. She is not going as
stewardess to Jamaica: Lord de Manton
has got "put on" to something, it's to do
with a Government Contract; and is very
secret and mysterious. They have taken a
maisonette in Chelsea, and I am so glad for
poor Lady de Manton, for they treated her
quite like one of themselves at her boarding-house
at Weston-super-mare.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Society Beauties</i></div>

<p>Your account of the ball was amusing;
Octavia looked after you, as I knew she
would, and managed to play Valmond very
cleverly for you. She wrote me herself to
say he was so firmly hooked that he would
be landed now without any difficulty. I
can't help smiling at your being surprised to
find that the Society beauties that the papers
rave about are <i>quite, quite old</i>, and not really
beautiful at all. Did you think that "age
could not wither them, nor custom stale
their infinite variety"? Nor was I at all
surprised to hear that they flirted with boys;
they always do at their age; it's their chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
amusement to pick out the nicest and handsomest
boys and make men of the world of
them. Dolly Tenderdown may only look
fifteen and behave "grown-up," but, depend
on it, he knows as much of life as
Lord Valmond. Those pretty youngsters
have a very quick intelligence, and between
the mess-room and the ball-room there is
not much that they have not learnt. Immaculate
to look at, my experience of them
is that they are anything but clean. Tom
Carterville belonged to another genus. The
Dolly Tenderdown kind only grows when
you fertilise the soil, but your Tom Cartervilles
grow wild in any soil and in all
seasons.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Boys in Society</i></div>

<p>I wish boys could be kept out of Society
till they are really grown-up, they are such
a nuisance. They never know how to preserve
their equilibrium, for they are either
intense, and make martyrs of themselves
like Stefano and Tom, or horrid, fast, impertinent
creatures like Dolly. And there
are so many boys in Society now-a-days.</p>

<p>The whole Parker family are at Claridge's,
and the Pullman is to take the Taunton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
guests up to town to-morrow. I shall stop
at the Carlton, and remain in London for a
few nights, and it is so much gayer there
than at the Buckingham Palace <i>d&eacute;pendances</i>.
It is an awful time of the year for a wedding,
but I suppose Miss Parker thinks that if
she postpones it, Clandevil may find another
bride still richer than herself. Lady Beatrice
is not going; she says nothing but family
business would take her to town in November.
I think the Parkers feel hurt about it,
because Lady Beatrice would give a sort of
backbone to the marriage feast that nobody
else would.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hospital Nurses</i></div>

<p>Mrs. Blaine has been pronounced out of
danger, but the girls have had to give up
the "Second Mrs. Tanqueray." The hospital
nurse from Bath has been so much
trouble that they have had to send her back,
and Daisy is nursing her mother. It seems
the nurse was very pretty, and Berty, who
has never been known to speak to a girl,
was found in the dining-room with her
at midnight with champagne and biscuits.
Blanche said, not between them, for they
were sitting so close together there wasn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
any room, but in front of them. And poor
Mrs. Blaine at 105&deg;, and no nourishment
had passed her lips for hours. Blanche will
go up to the wedding with me.</p>

<p>Talking of hospital nurses, it seems the
Vane-Corduroys had trouble with theirs too.
She wasn't pretty and flirtatious, but middle-aged
and "bossy," really to my mind more
objectionable than the Blaines'. She had
not been at Shotover an hour before she
took the measure of the household; the
doctor said Mr. Vane-Corduroy must be
kept quiet, and the nurse refused to allow
even his wife to see him. He was kept as
isolated as if he had had the plague, and
to amuse him nurse read "Paradise Lost"
aloud to him. She terrorised Mrs. Vane-Corduroy,
who fairly quaked in her presence;
she kept the servants constantly
doing things for her, had her meals served
her whenever she fancied them, had the
grooms riding into Taunton at all hours of
the day and night, and made her power felt
thoroughly, besides being paid I don't know
how many guineas a day, and if everything
was not done just as she wished it and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
once, she threatened that Mr. Vane-Corduroy
would die as a consequence. Her credentials
were so good that even the doctor
was afraid of her, but on the second day she
fell foul of the <i>chef</i>. His suite of rooms
was next to hers, and he was composing a
<i>menu</i> at the piano, which, as it was after midnight,
disturbed nurse a good deal. She
complained to Mrs. Vane-Corduroy the next
day, and poor Mrs. Vane-Corduroy, who is
terribly afraid of her <i>chef</i>, was driven nearly
distracted; nurse even sought out the <i>chef</i>
himself and ordered him to obey her, and
his reply was a gesture more rude than effective,
and even went so far as to threaten her
if she interfered with his province. That
night for dinner there was something with
a delicious port-wine sauce, and nurse, who
never touches spirits in any shape, didn't
know what she was eating, it was so disguised.
It upset her equilibrium completely, first, by
making her very merry and then by making
her horribly sick. She was so firmly convinced
that the <i>chef</i> had made an attempt
to poison her that she went off the first
thing the next day in high dudgeon, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the inexpressible relief of everybody at
Shotover.</p>

<p>I have a love of a frock and hat for the
wedding. I will write you next from London

<h2>LETTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">The Carlton Hotel</span><br />
Midnight, 13th November</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Wedding</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">The</span> Clandevil-Parker <i>noces</i> took place
to-day with great ostentation, as you
may imagine. You will read the report of
it to-morrow in the <i>Morning Post</i>, but I shall
probably be able to give you a more graphic
account of it. The ceremony was performed
by the Bishop of St. Esau at twelve o'clock,
at St. George's, Hanover Square, assisted by
other prelates of more or less note in the
ecclesiastical world. There was a thick yellow
fog that made several people arrive at the
church after everything was over, and prevented
the crowd from congregating as it
would otherwise have done. Blanche and I
had excellent seats, as we arrived early; the
bride was late owing to the fog, and Clandevil
looked awfully bored. Following the
American custom, there had been a full-dress
rehearsal of the ceremony the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
before, and the first five rows of pews had
been taken out, and the altar banked with
plants. The bridesmaids were all earls'
daughters, and the best man was that notorious
rake, the Honourable Ralph Swift;
everyone was remarking at his cleverness in
keeping out of jail. You will read all about
the costumes in the <i>Post</i>; the bride looked
well; the lace on her dress belonged to
Marie Antoinette, and the dress itself was an
exact duplication of that worn by the Queen
of Holland at her Coronation, saving of
course the royal mantle. Breakfast was
served afterwards at the Dowager Duchess
<span class="sidenote"><i>Wedding Presents</i></span>of Clandevil's in Eton Place, where the wedding
presents were on show! Their value,
apart from Mr. Parker's settlement on the
bride, of a square mile of New York with a
rental of two million dollars annually, is estimated
at five hundred thousand dollars,
the more costly gifts coming from across the
Atlantic. Mrs. Parker gave her daughter a
Holbein; Clandevil gave his bride a tiara of
emeralds; the Dowager Duchess gave a hot-water
bottle; Royalty sent the bride a lace
handkerchief, and the bridegroom a horse-shoe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
scarf pin set with brilliants; the Hon.
Ralph Swift gave a solid silver napkin ring;
Mr. Sweetson gave a necklace of diamonds
as big as walnuts; Mrs. Dot gave a dessert
set of S&egrave;vres specially made with the Clandevil
arms on it. The Marchioness of
Tuke, Clandevil's only sister, gave a solid
silver inkstand, and Lady Doreen Fitz Mortimer
and the Countess of Warbeck gave a
bog-oak blotting-pad, with a tortoise-shell
paper knife; the tenants at Clandevil gave a
gold loving-cup, and the servants an oak
chest of damask sheets; the clerks in Mr.
Parker's office in New York sent five pieces
of twelfth-century tapestry, and from various
people in America there came many magnificent
things. But Mr. Parker, Junior, the
brother, who is in Chicago, made a panic on
the Stock Exchange, and sent his profits;
the cheque was put to the new Duchess's
account at Coutts'. The happy pair left for
Clandevil Castle, Tipperary, where the
honeymoon will be spent. The Duchess
will be presented on her marriage at the first
drawing-room.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker seemed delighted, and talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
a good deal after the breakfast of "my son
the Duke;" Mrs. Parker seemed depressed,
and when she kissed her daughter good-bye,
said, "My child, I hope you will be happy."
Mr. Sweetson talked to me for some time
on triumphant democracy, and the effete
monarchies of the old world, his favourite
subjects. He said it was cheaper to buy
dukes in America than in England, but admitted
the price fluctuated, and depended
entirely on supply, which not infrequently
ran short of the demand. The atmosphere
of wealth was overpowering; Blanche said
she felt as if she were trampling on diamonds.
Everybody thinks it will be a most
happy match, for there is no pretence at
love on either side, and each has got what
each most desired. Flaxie Frizzle, the skirt-dancer,
and her two children came to the
church: everybody remarked how much the
boy looked like his father.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Wedding</i></div>

<p>I should have mentioned that the food
and drink were beyond cavil. Mr. Parker
told me he always got his "fizz" from the
Russian Court, as the best brands were sent
there from France. I cannot think of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
more to tell you of the wedding; the crowd
and the confusion were so great, I found it
difficult to take in all that happened.</p>

<p>Blanche and I returned to the Carlton at
three o'clock, and went straight to bed to
sleep off the effects. When we went to
dinner at eight, we saw the Vicomte de
Narjac at one of the tables; we had a long
chat with him afterwards. He came over to
London to purchase an English automobile,
and returns to Paris in a couple of days.
We told him of the grand wedding we had
been to, and he said he had seen a beautifully
dressed woman helped out of a hansom,
and carried upstairs unconscious, and when
he enquired what had happened, the porter
had told him in French that she was one of
the <i>invit&eacute;es aux &eacute;pousailles de M. le duc de
Clandevil avec une des plus grandes h&eacute;riti&egrave;res
du Nouveau Monde</i>. Blanche and I set
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se to find out who it could have
been, and she says it was the Marchioness
of Portcullis; we noticed at the breakfast
that she and Mr. Sweetson were drinking
neat brandy, and wondered at the time what
would be the result. The Vicomte was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
stupefied; he thought she was a demi-mondaine.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Lucerne Set</i></div>

<p>We asked the Vicomte all about the
Lucerne set. He says Mr. Wertzelmann
has been transferred to St. Petersburg, and
that Madame Colorado has gone to spend
the winter at the American Embassy; she
was such a dear friend of Mrs. Wertzelmann's.
The De Pivarts are in Paris; the
Marquis has a <i>proc&egrave;s</i> running in the Courts
against the Swiss Government, and hopes
he will make enough out of it to start a
stud in the spring. It seems the Marquise
was arrested on a steamboat on Lake
Geneva, being mistaken for Mrs. Phineas
<span class="sidenote"><i>Mrs. Porter</i></span>Porter, the beautiful American, whose husband
shot Monsieur Dupont in the Hotel
Beau Rivage. And the New York <i>Paris
Herald</i> has been full of it. Mrs. Phineas
Porter lives in Paris, and Mr. Phineas Porter
in Chicago; he comes over every year, and,
on this occasion, said good-bye to his wife
and left for Havre, but returned secretly, and
found Mrs. Porter had disappeared. He
traced her and Dupont, who is a prominent
member of the Jockey Club, to Geneva.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
He arrived late at night, knocked on his
wife's door at the Beau Rivage, who thought
he was the chamber-maid, and forced himself
in. Mrs. Porter shrieked, and Dupont,
who had retired for the night, jumped out
of bed, and was chased by Mr. Porter with
a loaded revolver through the whole suite
of apartments into the last room, and Dupont,
caught in a <i>cul de sac</i> as it were, hid
behind an arm-chair, where Mr. Porter
killed him. As you may imagine, the affair
created a scandal, for the people are so well
known in Society. Mr. Porter was arrested
by the police, and is now on trial. In the
confusion Mrs. Porter disappeared, and has
up to the present baffled all attempts to find
her. The Marquise de Pivart is said to be
the image of her, and, as she was embarking
about a week after the affair on a steamboat,
to spend the day at Chillon, she was arrested
by the stupid Swiss police. The Vicomte
says the Swiss authorities apologised most
humbly when they discovered their mistake,
but both the Marquis and the Marquise
would not be satisfied with anything less
than heavy damages. The <i>proc&egrave;s</i> has added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
to the Porter-Dupont <i>esclandre</i>, and the
reputation of the Marquise has been torn
to shreds. The Vicomte says it is very
amusing to read the accounts in the <i>Paris
Herald</i>, and everybody says the Marquis
could get a divorce as well as the Marquise,
but they swore the deepest affection
for one another in the courts, and will swear
anything for the chance of touching the
pockets of the Swiss Government. They
are always seen together just like the <i>ouvriers</i>
on Sundays at Nogent-sur-Marne. The
Vicomte added that the sacrifices they were
making of their private feelings were well
worth one hundred thousand francs, the
sum they claim as damages.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Roman Prince</i></div>

<p>Old Mrs. Johnson has found a Roman
Prince in the place of Count Albert for
Rosalie Isaacs. The Vicomte says he is all
that can be desired. He has a palazzo like
a fortress at Rome, with a priceless collection
of Greek marbles which he can't sell,
and was so poor that he spent one winter
on the Via Corniche, with a monkey and an
organ that he borrowed from his former
steward, who had just returned from tramping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
in America with enough to start himself
in a small business. But the Prince is not
bogus; he has the right to stand in the
presence of the King of Italy, and best of
all he is a Bourbon <i>sur la c&ocirc;t&eacute; gauche</i>. The
Vicomte thinks he cost infinitely less than
Clandevil cost the Parkers, and Rosalie's
wedding this winter in Rome will be much
more magnificent, for the Pope will marry
her, and the Royal Family will be present.
Mrs. Johnson must be <i>tr&egrave;s fi&egrave;re</i> of her success.
But, as Blanche remarked, the extraordinary
part of these American marriages
<span class="sidenote"><i>Elasticity of Conscience</i></span>is the elasticity of the religious conscience.
The Parkers are Baptists, yet Mr. Parker
has been restoring Gothic churches, and
Miss Parker, who has been "dipped," was
married by the Bishop of St. Esau. And
Mrs. Johnson, who told me in Lucerne that
she belonged to the Plymouth Brethren,
after marrying her daughter to a Jew and
her granddaughter to a Roman Catholic,
will actually receive the Papal benediction!
But of course, as I told Blanche, one must
be <i>&agrave; la mode</i>, and that I asked the Bishop
of St. Esau at the wedding if he would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote"><i>A Prayer for Paquin</i></span>put in a prayer for Paquin in the Litany
after "and all the nobility."</p>

<p>Well, my darling, I must say good-night;
it is frightfully late, and the champagne that
came from the Russian Court that I had
this morning, has given me just a wee bit
of a <i>migraine</i>.&mdash;Your dearest Mamma.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">The Carlton Hotel</span><br />
15th November</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Rainy Day</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">Yesterday</span> it rained as it only can
rain in London in November, and
when it stopped for a few minutes there was
such a nasty fog. We had breakfast in
bed, and didn't get up till quite twelve; it
was such a miserable day we didn't know
what to do with ourselves, so we went down-stairs
and sat in that jolly place with the
glass roof and the palms, and there was
quite a good band playing. There were
very few people there, as it isn't the season,
but about one o'clock a great many people
began to come for lunch. Most of the men
looked like Jews, and they all wore gold
rings with crests on their little fingers. I
am sure they were company-promoters, for
presently Lord de Manton arrived with
poor, tottering Lord Ardath, and joined
some of the Israelite people, and they all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote"><i>At Lunch</i></span>went in to lunch together. Little Dolly
Daydreams of the Tivoli drove up in a
hansom with that young simpleton, Percy
Felton, of the Scots Greys. We could see
them through the glass doors as they got
out of the cab; she lifted her skirt up to
her knee to keep it out of the wet, and he
kissed her on the ear right in front of the
porter. Lady Ann Fairfax, the war-special,
had lunch with six khaki men, and they
made such a noise at their table we could
hear them laughing where we were. Medina,
Viscountess Frogmore, and Mrs. Beverley
Fruit came together and sat down near us
for a few minutes when they were joined by
the Bishop of St. Esau and the three had
lunch together. The Viscountess was in
deep mourning, her crape veil trailed on the
ground behind her, and she looked very
melancholy; you know her son fell at
Magersfontein. A smart-looking curate,
evidently late, rushed up after they sat
down. Blanche says she thinks he is a
prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the Bishop's, he paid the greatest
deference to both the Bishop and Lady
Frogmore after lunch when they were having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
coffee outside in the glass place where
the band is. I am sure we shall hear of
him one of these days.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Conversation</i></div>

<p>A lank man, with long hair and a flabby
face, and a woman who looked the wife of
the editor of a newspaper, took the seats
next us vacated by Lady Frogmore and
Mrs. Fruit. The man criticised Mrs.
Fruit's books; Blanche whispered to me
that she thought he must be an unsuccessful
author, for he hadn't a good word to say
for either Mrs. Fruit or her works. The
conversation turned on to "An Englishwoman's
Love Letters." The woman said
she was dying to know who wrote them;
the man became quite mysterious, with a
could-if-I-would air. She playfully tapped
him on the arm with the handle of her
umbrella, and guessed <i>he</i> was the author.
He looked very self-satisfied, and admitted
he knew who the author was, but was bound
by frightful oaths never to divulge the
secret. But the woman wouldn't believe
him; she declared if he hadn't written the
book, he didn't know who did, for she was
constantly hearing people say they knew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
author and the reason he did not wish his
identity disclosed.</p>

<p>Then the conversation drifted on to Exeter
Hall, and Labouchere and Stead and the
Society notes in the <i>Daily Sensation</i>, and the
War in South Africa, and the man talked of
some poems he had written, and what the
critics had said of them, and the woman listened.
When he had exhausted himself, the
woman began. She talked of high life just
like a pocket peerage; she told anecdotes of
Royalty, which she said were perfectly true;
she knew what peers gambled, who married
actresses, who were divorced, who had a
<i>m&eacute;nage</i> in St. John's Wood, and she knew
what peeresses dyed their hair, and where
they did it, and what they said and what
they thought. She even mentioned Lady
Beatrice's name, and said that it was rumoured
Tom Carterville had gone back to South
Africa, because he was displeased that his
mother intended to marry a Low Church
curate. Poor Lady Beatrice! She also
mentioned me, and that I was the best
dressed woman in Society (dear Paquin), and
that it was considered very improper of me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
to let you visit at the places you did. I am
sure she was the wife of a journalist, for she
knew so much more about Society than
Society knew about itself or her.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lunch with the Vicomte</i></div>

<p>Just as Blanche and I were about to go to
lunch, the Vicomte arrived. He looked
immaculate and quite good-looking for a
Frenchman; he had been inspecting automobiles
the whole morning, and he was as
hungry as a lion. We had lunch together
in a corner, where we could see everybody;
after lunch, the Vicomte had an engagement
at the French Embassy, but he said he would
be back to dine with us, and take us to a
music hall. As the weather had mended, I
said I would go to Alice Hughes to have
my photograph taken, as I should have to
pay if I did not keep the appointment;
Blanche went to Marshall &amp; Snelgrove to
spend the afternoon. While I was waiting
at the "studio," old Lady Blubber came in;
she showed me her proofs, and was delighted
with them. They didn't look the least bit
like her; all the flabby rings under her eyes
were smoothed out, and her mouth was
made straight and the lump taken off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
bridge of her nose. She said she should
order three dozen, that they were the best
likeness she had ever had taken! After that
I went to a tea-shop in Bond Street, and
came back to the Carlton to find that
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se had taken the afternoon out. As I
can't, as you know, do the slightest thing for
myself, I was absolutely helpless, so I just
got into a wrapper, and read "Gyp" in front
of the fire. By and bye Th&eacute;r&egrave;se came; she
was spattered with mud as if she had been
spending the day in Fleet Street, and she
brought with her a strong odour of malt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Takes an Afternoon out</i></div>

<p>When I scolded her, ever so gently, for
going out without leave, she flew into a rage,
and wanted to know if I wished a month's
notice. Then she began to weep and pity
herself, and her cheeks were the colour of
lobsters, and she behaved very strangely. I
told her to get my bath ready, and she fell
asleep while it was filling, and the water
overflowed and did no end of damage. I
got very angry, and accused her of being
drunk, which she indignantly denied, saying
she had only been to see her mother who
lives in Soho. I sent her to bed after that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and Blanche laced me up and did my hair,
but I felt like a fright for the rest of the
night.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Goes to the Theatre</i></div>

<p>Dinner was rather tame, as there were so
few people in the room, but of course one
can't expect the season to last all the year
round. The Vicomte had, after great difficulty,
managed to get seats for "Mr. and
Mrs. Daventry." Between the acts we
heard people discussing who wrote it, and
in fact, it is as much of an enigma as the
authorship of "An Englishwoman's Love
Letters." Blanche thinks the same person
wrote both.</p>

<p>The Vicomte thought the play very
"polite," and was astonished that it had
created such a sensation. He said we ought
to see "La Dame aux Maximes" and
"Demie-Vierge," both now running in
Paris. We all agreed that the play was
thoroughly representative of Society, but
the unnatural parts were Daventry's suicide
and the elopement of his wife with Ashurst.
People don't do these things in our set.
The company was excellent, and Blanche
and I both wished we were Mrs. Pat Campbell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to have love made to us so delightfully
every night by young Du Maurier. Even
the Vicomte said they didn't do it better in
France, and he is sure Du Maurier did it so
well, because he was half French.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Supper at the Savoy</i></div>

<p>We had supper at the Savoy. The usual
sight. At a table near us was an actress
<i>tr&egrave;s d&eacute;collet&eacute;e</i>; six of our <i>jeunesse frivole</i> were
squabbling for her smiles. We left before
the lights were turned out, because the
people behave so badly in the corridor.
The Vicomte leaves for Paris to-morrow;
he is so much nicer in England than abroad.&mdash;Your
dearest Mamma.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXX</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">The Carlton Hotel</span><br />
17th November</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Elizabeth's Engagement</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">Hail</span>, Marchioness of Valmond, all
hail! Your letter gave me the greatest
possible pleasure. You have made the
match I desired for you, and I do not know
who deserves the greatest credit for it&mdash;you
who hooked this fine fish, Octavia who
helped you to land it, or I who taught you
how to fish, and then sent you to the pool
where my lord trout disported himself. But
apart from chaffing, Elizabeth, I am sincerely
glad for you, because Valmond really seems
to love you, and as men go, he will make
you a good husband. As soon as your visit
to Octavia is over, you must come straight
to me; we will go to Paris for the trousseau
and to Rome for the winter; a little delay
and absence will do Valmond good, and then,
darling, we will come to England and start
the season with your <i>noces</i>, which shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
done as befits a Marquis and Marchioness
of Valmond.</p>

<p>He wrote me to-day, as did Octavia; I
am replying by this same post to both. Assure
them both of my unfaltering affection.</p>

<p>I had intended going back to Monk's
Folly, but, since the news in your letter, I
have decided to stop in town till you come
in a day or two. Blanche sends her congratulations;
she has gone home, as Daisy
wanted a rest. Mrs. Blaine is on the high
road to recovery, and they will most likely
go to Rome with us.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Bazaar</i></div>

<p>Blanche left last night, after going with me
to the Bazaar for Distressed Gentlewomen.
It was held at Mauve House, lent by the
Duke of Mauve, and was under the patronage
of the Duke and Duchess, but organised
by Mr. Albert D. Beake, editor and
proprietor of "White Lies," said to be the
most successful of all the Society papers.
The Bazaar was opened by Royalty, and Mr.
Beake must have cleared a large sum for the
Distressed Gentlewomen as well as advertised
his paper and juggled himself and wife
into Society for once at any rate. His wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
is the woman I wrote you about the other
day, who came to the Carlton to lunch, and
talked so much about Society. I said at the
time she was an editor's wife. Mr. Beake
was everywhere, but his wife had a stall
with the Duchess of Mauve, who looked
awfully bored.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lady Hildegarde</i></div>

<p>One of the features of the bazaar was the
Stage Stall. Mr. Beake had got most of
the best known actors and actresses to take
part. It was a huge success; the people
were three deep round the stall, crushing
to see the professionals; they sold everything.
It was rather odd to observe the
stall immediately next to the stage one.
Lady Hildegarde Merrioneath presided, and
was assisted by some young and pretty girls.
The crowd did not know who they were,
and they hardly sold a thing. Lady Hildegarde,
who is the most refined and aristocratic
woman I know, with that mixture of
Vere de Vere and sweetness which so often
marks our best born women, stood in the
back of her stall, looking rather amused at
the complete desertion of it. Here was the
type of the real aristocrat, the real great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
lady, and the <i>parvenus</i> couldn't see it! I
felt like telling the people that they were
blind and fools, that if they had any taste,
any appreciation, any refinement, all the
other stalls would be deserted to overwhelm
Lady Hildegarde's. Mr. Beake, running
about with a china pig in his hands, which
he was trying to raffle, noticed that Lady
Hildegarde was not a success, and he actually
had the impudence to patronise her.
I suppose his vulgar commercial head was
turned with the thought that the bazaar
was his work, and that his wife was side by
side with a real live duchess. Lady Hildegarde
replied with some conventional remark,
and her smile seemed to me more
amused than ever, as if it were all very
funny and not worth being angry about.
For, after all, she was Lady Hildegarde
Merrioneath, and Mr. Beake was only Mr.
Beake, and his actors and actresses stars
whose lights went out. I shall never forget
the picture Lady Hildegarde made in
her deserted stall, side by side with the
crowded booth of the actors. It made me
think of the French Revolution, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
noblesse going to the guillotine in the tumbrils,
so far above her surroundings, was
Lady Hildegarde.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Existing R&eacute;gime</i></div>

<p>A little more pushing and shoving and
playing the "Charity trick," and Mr. and
Mrs. Beake will be like the Vane-Corduroys,
if, for all I know, they are not already
<i>rang&eacute;</i>. But, as Blanche said, the sentiments
that pervade the mind of Mr. Beake and
his kidney are the mainstay of our national
life and the existing r&eacute;gime, and it doesn't
do to guard the portals to the high born
too closely. As a future marchioness,
I pray you shudder when you read the
Sunday papers at Chevenix Castle with
the detailed account of Mr. Beake's
bazaar.</p>

<p>Blanche and I bought nothing, nor did
the few of our set who were there, which as
usual left the charity to the crowd.</p>

<p>I saw Blanche off at Paddington, and
wished I had decided to go with her; you
need not be surprised if you get a telegram
from me to-morrow to say I have gone home.
It is wretchedly dull by myself, and I can't
take Th&eacute;r&egrave;se with me everywhere; besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
I have to come up to my room early, as it
is not proper for me to sit in the public
rooms by myself at night.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Talks of Marrying again</i></div>

<p>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, in brushing out my hair to-night,
asked me why I didn't marry again; she
said that she knew men admired me, for one
of the Vane-Corduroys' footmen at Shotover
had told her I was a woman to drive men
mad. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se of course gauges the value
of men's admiration from the footman class,
but I think I have not yet got to the shady
side of beauty, and that perhaps it is just
as well Valmond saw you before he met me.
As money will never be a consideration, and
I have social position, and as I am not yet
forty-five, I shall not marry for love, so
I shall keep my freedom, which I enjoy so
much.</p>

<p>Once again, my darling, I congratulate
you, and wish you all happiness. Good-night.&mdash;Your
dearest Mamma.</p>

<h2>LETTER XXXI</h2>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Monk's Folly</span>, 19th November</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Elizabeth:</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Home again</i></div>

<p class="capd"><span class="dcap">Simply</span> couldn't endure it in town in
November by myself, so came home
to-day. Yesterday, after Blanche left, I
counted up the things I could do by myself
in order to kill time. In spite of London
being so big, there are so few things one can
do by oneself to amuse oneself. The early
post brought me the proofs from Alice
Hughes; Paquin comes out splendidly, but
I look silly in the one in which I am standing
near a balustrade, holding a sheaf of
wheat. I have ordered a dozen of myself
in a garden, under a lovely old tree, with a
stuffed greyhound at my side. It looks
awfully natural, and you would never dream
I was more than twenty. I thought the
proofs had been sent me by mistake, till I
recognised my frock, and then when you
look at them a long time, you see how really
like you they are. They are just the thing
to send one's acquaintances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lady Sophia Dashton's Novel</i></div>

<p>The morning was so foggy that I couldn't
go out, so I put on a very <i>chic</i> costume, and
sat in the glass-roof place which they call a
"garden," and read Lady Sophia Dashton's
novel. It is all about the Roman Emperors
and the catacombs, and the love of a princess
and a slave. The language is so beautiful,
and the descriptions are wonderful: they
seem as if they would never end, and you
forget all about the story. The book has
been well reviewed, and Lady Sophia has
taken up literature seriously. I have heard
she is making a great deal of money out of
it. Mr. Beake will publish anything she
writes&mdash;all the illustrated papers have got
her portrait this week&mdash;and there are stories
of hers now running in two of the leading
Society papers. She began to write for
pleasure, but has received such encouragement
that she decided to win the laurel.
Everybody in Society has bought her book.
The whole family are talented. Her father's
speeches in the House of Lords on the London
drains have been edited at 7s. 6d., with
the family arms on the cover; the <i>Times</i> said
they had the "ring of Burke in them," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Lady Sophia's brother's "Poems in odd
Moments," which have appeared in the
"Temple of Folly," are to be brought out
in book form. I forget the name of Lady
Sophia's novel; Mrs. Jack Strawe, in recommending
it to me the day of Miss Parker's
wedding, said she didn't know the name, and
that very few people did, but when ordering
it, it was only necessary to mention Lady
Sophia Dashton's name, and the bookseller
would know what you meant.</p>

<p>I sent Th&eacute;r&egrave;se to Mudie's for it, and
told her to ask for any other books that were
being widely read, as I like to be posted on
what is being talked of. She brought back
somebody's work on Aristotle, with an introduction
by the Duke of Mauve, and Mrs.
Katurah P. Glob's "There is no Death."
Mrs. Glob is a Christian Scientist, and states
in her preface that she is the seventh
daughter of a seventh son. I could only
get as far as what she had to say on vaccination;
I make out that she preferred to "render
unto C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's,"
rather than to incur the penalty of the law.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Dry Books</i></div>

<p>After struggling the whole morning with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Glob and Aristotle and Lady Sophia, and
wondering how learned people were, and
how they found time to acquire so much
knowledge, I had lunch. Cr&ecirc;me velours,
sole princesse, noisettes Souvaroff, pommes
nouvelles, etc., with F&eacute;lix Boubel, carte d'or,
took the dry taste of the books completely
out of my mouth.</p>

<p>Having spent such a morning improving
my mind at the Carlton, I thought I deserved
some relaxation in the afternoon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>At the Aquarium</i></div>

<p><i>Que faire?</i> Should I consult Salambo,
the well-known Oriental lady in Bond
Street, as to the future? Should I go to
Exeter Hall and observe the Ranter on his
native heath? Should I go to St. James
Hall and revel in Alice Gome's superb
voice? I did none of these things; I took
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se with me and drove to that popular
place of amusement, the Aquarium, as I had
never been there, and I wanted to see the
fishes. Alas! How sadly we English take
our pleasures! The only fish at the Aquarium
are some monsters of <i>papier mach&eacute;</i> and
a lonely <i>piscis vulgaris</i> condemned to solitary
confinement in a slimy tank. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
thought she would like to see the sword-swallowers,
so I took seats, and while we
waited, such a funny man told us he would
impersonate celebrities in quick change.
He did a lot of men with beards and long
hair, and held up bits of cardboard to let us
know who they were, and he called himself
Meyerbeer and Rossini, and, as Th&eacute;r&egrave;se
said, without the cardboard you wouldn't
have known which was which. Then he
did Lord Roberts and Baden-Powell and
the Prince of Wales; and when I saw him
put on his Lord Roberts' wig and jerk the
antimacassar off an arm-chair, I knew that
he would impersonate the Queen. And he
did, and you can have no idea how grotesque
it was, and the curtain dropped and
nobody applauded.</p>

<p>The sword-swallower did some amazing
things, and smacked his lips, as if the swords
tasted nice. His wife swallowed an electric
light, and then he told us of a trick he could
do which no one had ever done before in
England, namely, to swallow a sword and
hang weights on to the hilt, but he didn't do
it, as he said he had a sore throat. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
wouldn't wait for the lady who dives from
a trapeze into a tank, or drop pennies into
slots, or have my photo taken while I
waited, though I let Th&eacute;r&egrave;se have six shots
at a Boer behind a kopje in the shooting
gallery, but she nearly killed the attendant
after the third shot.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Rustic Footman</i></div>

<p>Th&eacute;r&egrave;se was so frightened, and began to
scream in French, that we had a crowd
round us in no time, and a policeman came
up and took our names. After that I decided
the Carlton was the best place for
me, till I could get my things packed and
go home. When I got back to the hotel,
I found some letters and a ten of diamonds
on the table in my room. At a loss to know
what significance it could have, I asked the
porter how it came into my room. He said
it had been left by a footman, but I was
none the wiser till this morning, when I
received a note from the Honourable Mrs.
Maxolme, explaining that her footman was
a simple honest rustic whom she had
brought up from the country with her, and
who was new to his duties. She had spent
the afternoon paying calls, and before starting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
had explained that it was merely a case
of leaving cards, and she told the youth to
take charge of them and bring a sufficient
number. She had paid all the calls, when
she suddenly remembered I was stopping
at the Carlton and she drove there.
The footman gave the card to the porter,
and then Mrs. Maxolme drove to a house
where she wished to leave two cards, and
called the footman and told him. But
it seems he had exhausted all he had brought,
and horrified Mrs. Maxolme by saying that
he had none left, as he had only brought
from the ace to the king of diamonds. Poor
Mrs. Maxolme has been writing to everybody
since to explain, and as she simply
could not write personally so many letters,
she wrote one and had the rest type-written.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Threatened with Influenza</i></div>

<p>Now, darling, I want you to come home at
once and tell Valmond to bring you, as I
wish to see him. I don't want to frighten
you, but the fogs and the dissipation of attempting
the London season in November
have made me ill. I arrived here with a
sore throat and a backache, and sent at once
for Dr. Smart. As I write, I have a mustard-plaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
on my chest and my feet in hot
water, and I have just swallowed a dose of
ammoniated quinine. I think I am in for
influenza. I feel a perfect wreck.&mdash;Your
dearest Mamma.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>P. S.</i>&mdash;Dr. Smart has just left; he says
if I will go to bed for forty-eight hours, he
will try to let me go to Lady Beatrice's big
dinner on Saturday. He is such a dear,
and has such white teeth and soft hands,
he drove all my fears away with such a
pooh, pooh! But when he had gone, I
heard Th&eacute;r&egrave;se tell the maid that I was
threatened with pleuro-pneumonia and had
a chill on the liver. So exaggerative these
French! I cannot write any more; my
hand is trembling so I can hardly hold the
pen, and I believe I am roasting with fever.
Bring the tea-gown I ordered at Paquin's
when you come. I am longing to see you
and Valmond. Don't alarm yourself about
me; I am really as hard as nails&mdash;and
influenza is <i>&agrave; la mode</i>.</p>

"I have read no book of modern times which so completely demanded
my undivided attention from the beginning to the end as
'The Column,' by Charles Marriott. It is a striking and, as it
seems to me, a faithful delineation of the strongest yet most natural
characters. The language is chaste and refined, the dramatic
interest intense, the plot powerful, and the whole work cleanly
and brilliantly intellectual. It is sure to take high rank in the
literature of the day."</small></p>

"Marriott, taken as an alternative after other literary forms, is
deeply welcome and full of wholesome succulence. He paces
up and down, as it were, in a hall where all is harmonious and
proudly beautiful, even fastidious.... It is a book full of repose,
even in its passion; and it is everywhere rich in beauty.... Mr.
Marriott comes among us a stranger and an alien; but he is
welcome, for he brings with him a beauty which lifts and purifies
the mind."</small></p>

fine book, a piece of art for which to be gladly thankful."</small></p>

"Whoever Charles Marriott may be ... he has written a very
remarkable novel.... The heroine is of a rare and original type.... A
book very fresh, very original, very interesting, and very
suggestive. He has handled situations and problems in the true
spirit of an artist."</small></p>

<p><small><b>The London Standard</b>:<br />
"'The real, bright thing.' ... The book is a very able one.
Moreover, it is full of beautiful things, of passages and ideas that
